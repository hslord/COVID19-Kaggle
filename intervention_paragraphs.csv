2254,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic and Pregnancy,Ensures service continuity Social distancing of healthcare workers Infection control and facilitates contact tracing Common feature of each team:
7308,Unknown unknowns – COVID-19 and potential global mortality,"The World Health Organisation estimates that:  14% of infected cases are severe and require hospitalisation.  5% of infected cases are very severe and require intensive care admission, mostly for ventilation.  4% of infected die. (9) Severity is associated with increasing age and co-morbidities such as chronic heart and lung disease.(9) This virus is highly contagious with an R0 of ≥3 i.e on average it appears that each case infects some 3 others. This sets off a chain reaction, in this particular case, with a doubling time of one week or less, so that populations reach 60-80% infection rates. It is naturally difficult to estimate rates as quite a few individuals are infected and remain well (especially children) but are contagious. (9) For this reason, unless large proportions of populations are tested, we cannot possibly accurately estimate the total that have actually contracted the disease. (8) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Draconian containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%. (10) This has not been the case elsewhere, and Italy has been severely affected with the number of patients infected since February following an exponential trend.(10) Intensive care units have been overwhelmed, with the bottleneck being availability of ventilators to tide critically ill patients over their intensive care stay. (10) This had led to suggestions that multiple patients could be ventilated with one machine, effectively multiplying intensive care capacity to deal with such -surges‖. (11) The careful application of basic containment measures cannot be overestimated: hand washing with soap and water, avoiding touching the face and social distancingstaying home, avoiding crowds and refraining from touching one another."
7308,Unknown unknowns – COVID-19 and potential global mortality,"Continent 1 is Asia. China may have contained the disease and has been assigned a potential infection rate of 10% with -normal‖ mortality of 4%. The rest of Asia is assumed to become up to 80% infected with 10% mortality due to health care services being overwhelmed. Continent 2 is Africa which is assumed to behave like the rest of Asia. Continent 3 is Europe which has so far shown overall too few and too late responses to the disease. For this reason, Europe has been assigned a 60% overall infection rate and a (perhaps) optimistic 4% -normal‖ mortality. Continent 4 is North America. The United States has reacted very poorly to date and hospitals are already filling up. This country also has issues pertaining to insurance and illegal and non-registered immigrants, and for this reason, a 10% mortality has been assigned in anticipation of health care services becoming overwhelmeed. Canada has also acted late and the same conditions have been applied. For Mexico, it has been assumed that social distancing strictures will be at least as difficult to enforce as in Europe, in the setting of a poorer health care system. Continent 5 is South America and this has been somewhat arbitrarily been assigned a 60% infection rate."
7308,Unknown unknowns – COVID-19 and potential global mortality,Continent 6 is Oceania (including Australia) and the population here has already responded poorly to social distancing measures so a 60% infection rate has been assigned to this region with a -normal‖ mortality rate.
7308,Unknown unknowns – COVID-19 and potential global mortality,"At the risk of sounding melodramatic, but with an extreme sense of realism, healthcare risks being plunged into the Middle-Ages if the public do not do their part. Infection cannot occur in the absence of contact. The only way to mitigate these numbers is to apply social distancing and take the precautions outlined above."
7914,Using psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19,"The worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises concerns of widespread panic and anxiety in individuals subjected to the real or perceived threat of the virus. Compared to general populations, patients who are institutionalized in a closed unit are also very vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and complications. This crisis touched on difficult issues of not only psychiatric care and ethics, but also psychological impacts to psychiatric care givers. In this Viewpoint, we address both physical and biopsychosocial aspects of this infection, as well as the psychoneuroimmunity of preventive strategies of healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, balanced nutrition, quality sleep and a strong connection with people. Social distancing and wearing masks might help us from pathogen exposure, yet such these measures also prevent us from expressing compassion and friendliness. Therefore, all forms of psychological support should be routinely implemented not only to consider psychological resilience but also to enhance psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19."
7914,Using psychoneuroimmunity against COVID-19,"COVID-19 is highly contagious because most persons lack immunity against this novel virus. Current COVID-19 therapy involves only treatment of symptoms, supportive care and prevention of complication, but no targeted medication is yet available. Therefore, the best strategy remains prevention, namely the reduction of pathogen exposure and enhancing individual immunity. Studies have shown that a healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, balanced nutrition, quality sleep and a strong connection with their families and communities are all associated with a boost to the immune system. During this outbreak, social distancing or wearing masks might help us to prevent infection, yet don't let these measures prevent us from expressing compassion and friendliness. Indeed, all forms of psychological support"
9429,Transmission potential and severity of COVID-19 in South Korea,"In particular, South Korea quickly became one of the hardest hit countries with COVID-19, exhibiting a steadily increasing number of cases over the last few days. Hence, it is crucial to monitor the progression of these outbreaks and assess the effects of various public health measures including the social distancing measures in real time."
9429,Transmission potential and severity of COVID-19 in South Korea,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Korea has been exacerbated by amplified transmission in confined settings including a hospital and a church in the city of Daegu. The hospital-based outbreak alone involves 118 individuals including 9 hospital staff (News, 2020) , which is reminiscent of past outbreaks of SARS and MERS (Chowell et al., 2015) . To respond to the mounting number of cases of COVID-19, the Korean government has raised the COVID-19 alert level to the highest (Level 4) on February 23, 2020 to facilitate the implementation of comprehensive social distancing measures including enhanced infection control measures in hospitals, restricting public transportation, cancelling social events, and delaying the start of school activities (Kim, 2020) ."
9429,Transmission potential and severity of COVID-19 in South Korea,"Moreover, the imported cases contribute little to the secondary disease transmission in Korea, as majority of these cases occurred in the early phase of the epidemic, with the most recent imported case reported on February 9, 2020. These findings support the range of social distancing interventions that the Korean government put in place in order to bring the outbreak under control as soon as possible."
9429,Transmission potential and severity of COVID-19 in South Korea,"Since the first COVID-19 case was reported on January 20, 2020, the epidemic's trajectory showed a rapid upturn until February 18, 2020, when a super spreader (Case 31) was identified in the Shincheonji (Cowling et al., 2015) . Amplification of MERS in the hospital setting has been associated with diagnostic delays, which increase the window of opportunity for the generation of secondary cases (Chowell et al., 2015) . This underscores the need for rapid testing, case detection and active contact tracing to isolate infectious individuals."
9951,Community pharmacists and communication in the time of COVID-19: Applying the health belief model,"In late 2019, the World Health Organization was alerted to a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City in China; the novel coronavirus responsible for this outbreak was named 2019-nCOV, 1 and the disease the virus causes is now known as COVID-19(coronavirus disease 2019). 2 The previously-unknown virus in question was later found to be highly transmissible, with the average infected person spreading the disease to up to 3 other people. 3 Initial reported case fatality ratesranged from2.5% to 3%, 4,5 prompting a global response. Communities around the world have been advised to stay in their homes as much as possible, avoid gatherings, frequently wash their hands or employ other hand hygiene techniques, remain at least 1 to 2 meters away from others (""social distancing""), and avoid touching their faces to avoid or delay transmission of 2019-nCOV. 1, 2 These guidelines would severely hamper many day-to-day activities if implemented at a high level of fidelity, so voluntarycompliance is likely to be uneven at best."
9951,Community pharmacists and communication in the time of COVID-19: Applying the health belief model,"All constructs of the HBM are underpinned by an individual's background and experiences. Thus, the community pharmacist should bear in mind the patient's demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and knowledge base. These things will interact directly with the constructs that comprise individual belief. In the United States, for example, persons of lower socioeconomic standing may not have access to all of the tools needed to overcome all perceived barriers to action. Persons of differing ethnic backgrounds may react differently to calls for social distancingdue to varying cultural attitudes and norms regarding interpersonal interactions. An exhaustive list of how all modifying factors may interact with other HBM constructs in the context of COVID-19 is beyond the present scope, though some thoughts on modifying factors will be provided when discussing other constructs of the HBM. As community members themselves, community pharmacists are uniquely positioned to understand how these factors may impact their patients. Community pharmacists are encouraged to consider how their patients' perspectives on COVID-19 may differ from their own, and to modify communication strategies accordingly."
9951,Community pharmacists and communication in the time of COVID-19: Applying the health belief model,"In the case of COVID-19 prevention behaviors, perceived barriers are likely to be profound in many cases. Manycultures are not configured to operate with minimal contact outside of the home for extended periods. In most industrial and post-industrialeconomies, people will likely need income to afford housing, food, and other essentials. Because of population density, people living in urban areas may find it difficult to practice effective social distancing when they must leave their residences. Additionally, some individuals may find the psychological distress that comes with spending more time away from others or the fear of the disease to be a barrier in its own right. Other individual factors may present special barriers, such as having to find appropriate childcare following school closings. Many of these barriers may be beyond the capacity of a community pharmacist to resolve in a brief encounter, but the pharmacist should be willing to work with and appropriately reassure a concerned patient as time constraints allow."
9951,Community pharmacists and communication in the time of COVID-19: Applying the health belief model,"Community pharmacists can help patients who express difficulties with perceived self-efficacy with respect to COVID-19 prevention behaviors. This may be as simple as listening to concerns regarding isolation and social distancing, then reinforcing positive steps that have already been taken. Pharmacies can reinforce self-efficacy beliefs by working with patients who experiment with mail order refills, drivethrough pharmacy, or other contact-minimization methods. These measures can be presented to patients as proof of their ability to take effective action. Ultimately, it will be vital to understand the individual and their contexts. The preexisting relationships community pharmacists have with their patient populations will be similarly invaluable. Example questions to assess perceived self-efficacy:"
9951,Community pharmacists and communication in the time of COVID-19: Applying the health belief model,"In the HBM, ""cues to action"" are prompts that remind individuals that they should act on a particular challenge. This is another construct that community pharmacists are likely to act on in the course of everyday practice. In the past, this may have meant reminding patients of medication adherence behaviors or counseling on smoking cessation. In the context of COVID-19 prevention behaviors, it may mean reminding patients standing in line to practice social distancing or advising patients who exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 to quarantine themselves for the length of time suggested by their doctor. Community pharmacists should take care to practice cultural competence when providing guidance: some communities and individuals will want their healthcare professionals to be cooperative and consultative, while others may prefer simple, clear directions from an expert."
9951,Community pharmacists and communication in the time of COVID-19: Applying the health belief model,"COVID-19 presents a unique challenge to public health. Effective mitigation of the disease will require nontrivial efforts from a significant fraction of the world population, including social distancing and avoiding unnecessary interactions with others. No matter how stringently these measures are recommended, a fraction of people may not believe that they can or should act in ways that will limit the threat. The HBM is a model that has been used to study behaviors related to preventing or mitigating disease. It conceptualizes beliefs about disease as being comprised of the perception of the threat as severe and relevant, the perception of benefits of and barriers to acting, and the perception of one's intrinsic ability to act. As trusted, community-facing healthcare professionals, pharmacists are uniquely suited to bring about change in patient behaviors.Community pharmacists using HBM to reinforce COVID-19 mitigation behaviors should appropriately emphasize the severity and susceptibility of the threat, emphasize barriers to acting, help patients identify ways to overcome barriers to acting, and reinforce self-efficacy beliefs."
9951,Community pharmacists and communication in the time of COVID-19: Applying the health belief model,"Community pharmacists are likely to have a direct role in combating misinformation and helping patients select healthy behaviors. To that end, the HBM's constructs of perceived threat, perceived barriers, perceived benefits, perceived self-efficacy, and cues to action can be immediately deployed to help reinforce COVID-19 limiting behaviors, such as social distancing and remaining in the home whenever possible."
10459,Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography Guidance for Use of Cardiac Computed Tomography Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The world is currently suffering through a pandemic outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 . The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently advises medical facilities to ""reschedule nonurgent outpatient visits as necessary"" (1). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the United Kingdom National Health Service and several other international agencies covering Asia, North America and most regions of the world have recommended similar ""social distancing"" measures (2, 3) ."
10459,Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography Guidance for Use of Cardiac Computed Tomography Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic,"• Social distancing -keeping at least six feet (1.8 meters) between individuals in waiting rooms and work spaces as much as feasible. • Encourage sick employees to stay home. Personnel who develop respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) or unexplained fever should be instructed not to report to work. • Ensure that your sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of these policies. Make contingency plans for increased absenteeism • Screen patients and visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever, cough, difficulty breathing) or gastrointestinal symptoms and coronavirus exposure in the last 2 weeks before entering one's healthcare facility (4). • Ensure technologist and CCT imager hand hygiene best practices. If soap and water are not readily available, use of a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. • Consider standard droplet precautions for patients and healthcare personnel as per institutional infection control protocols. • Increase scheduling intervals or appointment times to allow adequate time to clean equipment as needed. • Leverage telemedicine technologies and isolated workstations to allow for reading and interpretation, that allow for social distancing to limit staff exposure, when possible. • Assign a team member to monitor and incorporate regular updates from the CDC and appropriate regional jurisdictions."
10459,Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography Guidance for Use of Cardiac Computed Tomography Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic,"To advise practitioners of cardiovascular CT on how to implement the CDC recommendation of rescheduling non-urgent visits as necessary and international guidelines on social distancing, the SCCT offers the following guiding points ( Table 1) and suggestions for CCT timing based on various indications ( Table 2) . As this is not an exhaustive list, the SCCT advises CCT practitioners to work with referring physicians on a case by case basis.

The duration that these ""social distancing"" measures were kept in place correlated with a reduced total mortality burden 4 . Although we still have no known effective therapy or vaccine prevention for this coronavirus, and the world is a quite different place than it was 100 years ago, the efficacy of the measures instituted during the 1918-19 pandemic gives us hope that the current measures will also limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic."
10552,The COVID-19 pandemic: Implications for the cytology laboratory,"It is important to address the fact that this epidemic will unavoidably generate stress, fear and anxiety among the entire laboratory personnel, trainees and pathologists 57, 58 . Psychologic stress may be experienced differently by different people, and may be modulated by personal factors like age, sex, health status, baseline anxiety level and risk perception. More severe psychologic distress may be followed by increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology 59 . Psychological distress may be related to increased work load due to coworker absenteeism, lack of socialization with friends and colleagues, lack of recreational activities due to the closure of gyms, restaurants, movie theaters and other recreational avenues, and increased family stress and parenting issues due to children being at home as a result of school closings. It may also relate to having a friend or family member affected by the disease. All healthcare workers may also feel anxious and stressed due to the fear of contracting the disease, fear of transmitting the disease to members of the family, or financial fears related to the changes implemented during this period. During this period, laboratory directors and other pathologists should be prepared to provide up to date information regarding the most recent developments in our knowledge about the disease and candid information regarding all aspects of the personnel's job. Although such information may also be available from a variety of sources, including the CDC and the health care center's website, in order to alleviate the fear and anxiety, it is important to have clear channels of communication, transmit the information in person, and respond to any questions that may arise. Providing emotional support and an opportunity to discuss any personal and family concerns is crucial during these times. It is very important to communicate effectively the risk to laboratory personnel and trainees, without overly reassuring them, and acknowledging that a lot is unknown about this infection. It is equally important to communicate any changes in policy or schedule as soon as possible 60 . If physical meetings are not possible because of the social distancing measures implemented, web-based conferences using a variety of platforms can be used. This can include SMS text messages, e-mails, using both institutional and personal email, if needed, small group discussions, and websites, in addition to online discussion through apps such as Finally, in addition to these measures meant to prevent infection in the workplace, all pathologists, trainees, cytotechnologists and laboratory personnel should also apply commonsense measures to prevent getting infected outside the laboratory environment. This may include, in addition to personal hygiene measures (handwashing, avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth), ""social distancing"", avoiding close contact with other people, and, if possible, avoiding public transportation, avoiding crowds and gatherings of over 10 people, avoiding contact with people who might be sick (i.e. people having fever and respiratory symptoms)."

Also, because multiple unlinked community cases of COVID-19 have been reported (21) , various social distancing measures have been put in place including advising the public against large social gatherings in order to mitigate the risk of community transmission (22, 23) .

34026,Transmission potential of COVID-19 in South Korea,"The number of cases of COVID-19 in the province of Hubei, the disease epicenter, quickly climbed following an exponential growth trend. The total number of COVID-19 cases is at 81,109 including 2718 deaths in China as of February 26, 2020 (3) . Fortunately, by February 15, 2020 the daily number of new reported cases in China started to decline across the country although Hubei Province is still reporting hundreds of cases per day as of February 26 th , 2020 (3) . While the epidemic continues to decline in China, more than 2,900 COVID-19 cases have been reported in 37 countries outside of China including South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran, Singapore, U.S., and Thailand (3) . In particular, South Korea has quickly become the second hardest hit country with COVID-19, with steadily increasing number of cases over the last few days. Hence, it is crucial to monitor the progression of these outbreaks and assess the effects of various public health measures including the social distancing measures in real time."
34026,Transmission potential of COVID-19 in South Korea,"This is the first study to report estimates of the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Korea based on the trajectory of the epidemic, which was reconstructed by using the dates of onset of the first reported cases in Korea. The estimates of R clearly indicate sustained transmission of the novel coronavirus in Korea. Moreover, the imported cases contribute little to the secondary disease transmission in Korea, as majority of these cases occurred in the early phase of the epidemic, with the most recent imported case reported on February 9, 2020. These findings support the range of social distancing interventions that the Korean government put in place in order to bring the outbreak under control as soon as possible."

34026,Transmission potential of COVID-19 in South Korea,"Beyond Korea, substantial COVID-19 transmission has been reported in Singapore, Iran, Italy, Germany and aboard the Diamond cruise ship (35, 36) . While the cluster A and the Chungdo Daenam hospital cluster in Korea seem to have stabilized, the other two clusters are likely to keep growing in the short term. Public health authorities are currently focused on containing the outbreak in the city of Daegu, the epicenter of the outbreak and North Gyeongsang Province where active contact tracing is being conducted. Nation-wide preventative measures are expected to reduce the community transmission and ultimately bring below one."

34099,Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China,"The COVID-19 outbreak has spread widely across China since December 2019, with many other countries affected. The containment strategy of integrated nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including travel bans and restrictions, contact reductions and social distancing, early case identification and isolation have been rapidly deloyed across China to contain the outbreak, and the combination of these interventions appears to be effective. We "
34099,Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China,"To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study to date on quantifying the relative effect of different NPIs and their timings for COVID-19 outbreak containment, based on human movement and disease data. Our findings show that NPIs, inter-city travel restrictions, social distancing and contact reductions, as well as early case detection and isolations, have substantially reduced COVID-19 transmission across China, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. Our findings contribute to improved understanding of integrated NPI measures on COVID-19 containment and can help in tailoring control strategies across contexts."
34099,Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China,"As of February 28, 2020 the COVID-19 outbreak has caused 78,961 confirmed cases (2791 deaths) across China, with the majority seen in Wuhan City, and 4691 cases (67 deaths) reported in the other 51 countries. 1 Further spread has occurred to all populated continents of the World, with many anticipating that a pandemic is approaching. 2, 3 As an emerging disease, effective pharmaceutical interventions are not expected to be available for months, 4 and healthcare resources will be limited for treating all cases. Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are therefore essential components of the public health response to outbreaks. 1, [5] [6] [7] These include isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, travel restrictions, school and workplace closures, and cancellation of mass gathering events. [5] [6] [7] These containment measures aim to reduce transmission, thereby delaying the timing and reducing the size of the epidemic peak, buying time for preparations in the healthcare system, and enabling the potential for vaccines and drugs to be used later on. 5 For example, social distancing measures have been effective in past influenza epidemics by curbing human-to-human transmission and reducing morbidity and mortality. [8] [9] [10] Three major NPIs have been taken to mitigate the spread and reduce the outbreak size of COVID-19 across China. 11, 12 First, inter-city travel bans or restrictions have been taken to prevent further seeding the virus during the"

People in China were estimated to make close to 3 billion trips over the 40-day CNY travel period from January 10 to February 18, 2020. 12,13 A cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei Province was put in place on January 23, 2020, just two days before CNY's day on January 25. However, Wuhan's lockdown is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before CNY, with around 5 million people likely leaving before the start of the travel ban, departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. 14 Since CNY's day, travel restrictions in other provinces were also put in place across the country."
34099,Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China,"The second group of containment measures involves improving the screening, contact tracing, identification, diagnosis, isolation and reporting of suspected ill persons and confirmed cases. 11 Since January 20, particularly in Wuhan, searches for cases, diagnosis and reporting have sped up across the country."

In Wuhan, where the largest number of infected people live, residents were required to measure and report ther temperature daily to confirm their onset, and those with mild and asymptomatic infections were also quarantined in ""Fang Cang"" hospitals, which are public spaces such as stadiums and conference centres that have been repurposed for medical care. 11 The average interval from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation has dropped from 12 days in the early stages of the outbreak to 3 days in early February, highlighting how the efficiency of disease detection and diagnosis has greatly improved. 15, 16 Third, inner-city travel and contact restrictions were implemented to reduce the risk of community transmission. This involved limiting individual social contact, using personal hygiene and protective measures when people needed to move in public, and increasing the physical distance between those who have COVID-19 and those who do not. 11 As part of these social distancing policies, Chinese government encouraged people to stay at home as much as possible, cancelled or postponed large public events and mass gatherings, and closed libraries, museums, and workplaces. 17, 18 Additionally, to fully cover the suspected incubation period of COVID-19 spread before Wuhan's lockdown, the CNY and school holidays were also extended, with the holiday end date changed from January 30 to March 10 for Hubei province, and Feb 9 for many other provinces. [19] [20] [21] The implementation of these NPIs has coincided with the rapid decline in the number of new cases across China, albeit at high economic and social costs. 15, 16 On February 17, the State Council required localities to formulate differentiated county-level measures for precise containment of the COVID-19 outbreak and the restoration of socioeconomy affected by the outbreak. 22 The timing of implementing and lifting interventions is likely to have been and continue to be important, to take advantage of the window of opportunity to save lives and minimize the economic and social impact. 23, 24 The increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 outside China and establishment of secondary transmission in multiple places highlights its pandemic potential.

34099,Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China,"Generally, the early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to quickly and substantially prevent more infections than contact reduction and social distancing across the country (5-fold versus 2.6-fold), but without the intervention of contact reductions, in the longer term, the epidemics would increase exponentially. Therefore, integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect on COVID-19 outbreak containment ( Table 1 )."
34105,SOCRATES: An online tool leveraging a social contact data sharing initiative to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19,"Given the expanding pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 disease, it is of great importance to consider and plan intervention strategies to slow down SARS-CoV-2 spread, with the aim to flatten the epidemic peak, and thus decrease surge capacity problems arising to health care provision and essential supplies. This may also allow to buy time for interventions, such as specific antivirals (and perhaps vaccines) to become available for widespread use [1] . Social distancing on a large scale, first at the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, and later in other locations was shown to slow down SARS-CoV-2 spread (e.g. in Shanghai [2] )."
34105,SOCRATES: An online tool leveraging a social contact data sharing initiative to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19,"Social contact surveys have proven to be an invaluable source of information about how people mix in the population [3] [4] [5] . They have been shown to explain close contact infectious disease data well [6] [7] [8] . During the A(H1N1)v2009 pandemic, contact survey data were used to reproduce the observed incidence patterns of the emerging outbreak [9] . Hens et al. [10] used social contact data collected in the POLYMOD project [4] to quantify the impact of school closure on the spread of airborne infections. This was done by comparing the basic reproduction number, or the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population, derived using mixing patterns observed on weekends or during a holiday period with those derived using mixing patterns observed on weekdays. By considering mixing patterns at different locations including or excluding the contribution of some of these locations, social distancing measures can be mimicked and their impact on disease spread can be investigated to potentially guide policy makers."

34105,SOCRATES: An online tool leveraging a social contact data sharing initiative to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19,"Based on the reported contact locations, it is possible to exclude or reduce subsets of the social contact data. To do so, contacts at multiple locations were assigned to a single location in the following hierarchical order: (1) contacts at home, (2) contacts at work, (3) contacts at school, (4) contacts during transportation, (5) contacts during leisure activities and (6) contacts in other locations. For example, school closure can be simulated by excluding all contacts that took place ""at school"" before calculating m ij .

This application consists of a user interface (UI) and server script that use data processing algorithms based on the socialmixr package [11] . The UI enables the selection of a country, age categories, type of day (weekday, weekend, holiday, regular), contact duration (<15min, >15min, >1h, >4h), contact intensity (physical or non-physical) and gender (femalemale, male-female, male-male, female-female). Using a selection box, the user can opt to disable the assumption of reciprocity and participant weights by age and type of day. Finally, the user can enable reactive strategies such as school closure and increase the level of telework. Please note that the proportion of telework can only increase given a specified observed proportion. The extrapolation of social contact matrices given reductions in telework falls outside the scope of this project."

In order to do this, we use 3 age classes: 0-18 years, 19-60 years and over 60 years of age. For each country, we calculate contact rates between each age group after excluding data from holiday periods. We exclude compensation behavior if people do not go to work or school, to simulate quarantine-like scenarios. We fixed the reference proportion of telework at 5%, in line with European observations [Eurostat, 2020; https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/].

For most countries, we predict a 10% decrease in the R 0 with a telework proportion of 50%. In some countries, like China, Poland and Hong Kong, the reduction is slightly higher. The analysis for Peru shows little impact of telework. This can be explained by the observation of Grijalva et al [20] that participants reported few contacts at work whereas a substantial proportion of contacts was reported at the market or street.

34105,SOCRATES: An online tool leveraging a social contact data sharing initiative to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19,"The relative incidence, as presented in Figure 3 , shows the impact of school closure compared to an increase in telework. The predicted relative incidence in people 18-60 years of age decreases with an increasing proportion of telework. That is, this measure provides some protection from exposure, which might be of interest if these age groups are more vulnerable compared to children, as is the case for COVID-19 [34] . The relative incidence in the age group above 60 years of age increases in both situations compared to no intervention. This does not imply that the absolute number of cases in this age group would rise. This only means that the risk of infection in other age groups is more affected by the intervention (which reduces overall incidence) relative to their normal social contact behavior. Given that our intervention measures target only children and the population of working age, this observation is as expected."

By Jan 25, 30 provincial governments in China activated first-level public health emergency response. Hence, In addition to strict quarantine management, substantial social distancing measures to limit population mobility and to reduce within-population contact rates were executed almost in the whole country. For example, public activities were canceled; communities adopted enclosed management; the national holiday of Spring Festival and the winter vacation were extended so that work resumption and school re-opening could be extensively postponed. In addition, people were required to wear facemasks in public. However, with all those efforts, the prevalence of COVID-19 was escalating."
34127,The impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: A data-driven SEIQR model study,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions to interrupt transmission could be implemented immediately, gaining time for pharmaceutical development. Briefly, there were three steps of non-pharmaceutical interventions for reducing contact rates between susceptible individuals and infected individuals. First, quarantine management, i.e. quarantining the infected, the suspicious and their close contacts; second, social distancing to confine within-population contact; third, locking down the epicenter to prevent further exportation of infected and latently infected individuals to other regions."

Theoretically, if substantial social distancing and/or epicenter lockdown were implemented early enough, there would be no prevalence or no spreading. But realistically, it takes time for preliminary investigation. Besides, rigorous measures would bring about deep social influences and economic consequences. So, it is challenging to choose the right response at the right scale in the right area at the right time [4] , especially when the transmission pattern and clinical characteristics were not fully understood."

34127,The impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: A data-driven SEIQR model study,"In this study, SEIQR models were developed to simulate the COVID-19 epidemic in China. We built three SEIQR models to simulate the epidemic in Wuhan, the rest of Hubei Province, and other provinces and municipalities in China, respectively. Other provinces and municipalities studied here include nine provinces (i.e. Zhejiang, Guangdong, Henan, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Shangdong and Sichuan) and three municipalities (i.e. Chongqing, Beijing and Shanghai) in China, which covered 90% infections in mainland China.

These models were able to simulate the COVID-19 epidemic with interventions activated on different dates. Figure 1 describes the framework of building estimation models. The reported confirmed, recovered and death cases were used to build initial models for Wuhan, Hubei and other provinces. Since there could be considerable under-reporting bias in the epicenter for lots of reasons. We assumed that the cases reported by other provinces were more accurate. Therefore, the model built on the cases reported by other provinces could estimate more accurately the number of infections. The reproductive number, infectious period and mean latent of models built for Wuhan and Hubei should be revised based on the latently infected individuals. The number of latently infected individuals in Wuhan before Jan 23 was estimated by the latently infected ratio and the daily population migration data from Wuhan to the rest of China. In the revised models of Wuhan and Hubei, parameters involving social distancing measures such as the removed rate, the decline factor of the reproductive number and the isolating ratio of susceptible individuals inherited from the initial models. The daily latent infected ratio is calculated based on the daily number of exposed individuals in Wuhan and the daily susceptible population size. Through the daily latent infected ratio and the daily number of individuals leaving Wuhan, the daily number of exposed individuals exported to Hubei and other provinces can be estimated."

The base reproductive number r0 of Wuhan and Hubei was set to 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) referring to the study of Liu, Q., et al [1] .

Some research suggested social distancing is effective, under the condition of early activation and long-lasting implement of combined measures [8] , strict implement [6, 9] , and spontaneously adopted [10] ; some concluded the effectiveness was mild [11] ; some argued that moderate social distancing can worsen the disease outcome, [6, 9] But real-world studies are rare. Here we quantified the impact of social distancing on the epidemic size in the real world, providing evidence that social distancing is effective to interrupt the transmission of the respiratory pathogen, especially with early implementation and to a substantial extent.

34127,The impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: A data-driven SEIQR model study,"Unexpectedly, our results showed that the significant decrease of the epidemic size by earlier social distancing would be partially neutralized by earlier epicenter lockdown. Further investigation suggested that the influences of epicenter lockdown on epidemic size and death differed between Wuhan and non-Wuhan regions. Earlier lockdown of Wuhan would deteriorate the situation in situ, but would largely lower the infection number in the rest of Hubei province and other provinces. The reasons may be as follows. After lockdown, a portion of the infected and the latently infected (the exposed in the model) would accumulate in Wuhan instead of exporting outside. Theoretically, it would not change the total infection or death number, but we found the conversion rate from the close contacts to the exposed is much higher in Wuhan than in other provinces, as listed in table S1 of Supplement Material, so is the death rate. Quickly surging infected patients in Wuhan exerted extraordinary pressure on local healthcare systems, resulting in an acute shortage of medical resources and healthcare workers. Then the fast-growing infection and resource shortage fueled each other in a vicious cycle. Numerous close contacts could not be quarantined for medical observation."
34127,The impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: A data-driven SEIQR model study,"One is about the comprehensiveness of the interventions. In addition to the mainly discussed strategies of social distancing and epidemic lockdown, measures implemented in China also included forceful medical supports to Wuhan, reinforced quarantine management, and public health measures, e.g. requiring people to wear masks in public, raising public awareness for hand hygiene. Although these measures were not specifically discussed, their effectiveness has been illustrated by the adjustment of daily removed rate, and the decline of the base productive number r0 in our model."
34127,The impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: A data-driven SEIQR model study,"Another is about the time range of the interventions evaluated in this paper. We choose Jan 3, 2020 as the earliest available time point to implement interventions of social distancing and/or epicenter lockdown for two reasons. Practically, it is the date Wuhan started close contact management [1] , a kind of preliminary quarantine management. Taking the move before this date could be better, but scarcely possible, so beyond the scope of our discussion."
34127,The impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China: A data-driven SEIQR model study,"In addition, the application of our results should be tailored in a different situation. The non-Hubei provinces we studied were the ten provinces with most infections besides Hubei, plus the two municipalities of most importance in mainland China. These provincial regions had a large inflow of people from Wuhan, and had a high local population density. So there were more imported cases, and easy to trigger widespread local transmission. For those regions with little people flow from the epicenter and with a population of low density, it could be possible that reinforced quarantine management without stringent social distancing could be effective enough to interrupt local transmission. An extreme example is that there was only one COVID-19 case in Tibet Autonomous Region of China, and the one was an imported case from Wuhan. He was timely quarantined for treatment and discharged after recovery. 23 close contacts were quickly traced and quarantined for medical observation, and then ruled out of infection. For other regions in and out of China, the specific measures may be adjusted to the different social-political-economic environment."

34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"In December 2019, Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. 1 It has since spread globally, reaching more than three dozen countries with over 80,000 confirmed cases by late February. 2 To reduce further spread of the disease, governments have implemented community measures to increase social distancing for those at highest risk of infection. 3 In China, policies include unprecedented lockdowns to reduce contacts between individuals, travel restrictions, and door-to-door temperature checks with mandatory mass quarantine. 4 Contact tracing, a core strategy to control disease, is used to identify individuals who may have been exposed to an infectious disease and to focus interventions on this high risk group. If identified contacts are symptomatic when found, they are promptly isolated and treated in a healthcare setting. More often, contacts are found healthy, and may or may not be infected. Depending on how much time has passed since exposure to the primary infected individual, those infected may not yet be symptomatic -this period of time between infection and symptoms is an important epidemiological trait of an infectious disease called the incubation period. How to handle these symptom-free contacts is a recurring point of confusion and controversy, particularly for emerging infectious diseases. Two essential strategies are used: individual quarantine and active monitoring. Individual quarantine involves the separation from others of an individual who is believed to be exposed to the disease, but not currently showing symptoms of it. A less restrictive intervention, active monitoring, involves assessing the individual for symptoms at regular intervals and, if symptoms are detected, promptly isolating the individual."
34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"The relationship between symptoms of a disease and infectiousness to others is critical to the success of containment strategies. Previous work has found that a disease's natural history, particularly the amount of transmission that occurs before symptom onset, greatly influences the ability to control outbreaks 5 and the relative effectiveness of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring. 6 Short-course diseases, such as influenza, and diseases with long periods of presymptomatic infectiousness, like hepatitis A, are impacted more strongly by quarantine than by active monitoring; however, quarantine is of limited benefit over active monitoring for the coronaviruses MERS and SARS, where persons usually show distinctive symptoms at or near the same time that they become infectious. Recent work on isolation for COVID-19 found a potentially large impact of perfect isolation, if one assumed there was limited presymptomatic transmission and a high probability of tracing contacts to be put under isolation immediately following symptom onset. 7 Our framework enables comparison of active monitoring and individual quarantine and considers parameters such as delays, and imperfect isolation to account for known nosocomial transmission of this respiratory virus. 8 One of the key uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 is the extent of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission. A recent study reporting asymptomatic transmission in Germany 9 was later found to be incorrect or misleading, 10 adding to the confusion. There has also been uncertainty about the serial interval -the time between symptom onset of infector-infectee pairs -which in turn reflects uncertainty about the extent of presymptomatic transmission. Early estimates by Nishiura et al 11 and Li et al 12 were derived from limited data (24 and 6 infector-infectee pairs, respectively) and in the latter case largely reflected the prior distribution derived from SARS cases in 2003. Given the severe impact of quarantine on both resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions quarantine can effectively control COVID-19, and among these under what conditions it is substantially more effective than less restrictive approaches such as active monitoring, particularly given uncertainty in essential disease parameters. Here, using methods described in previous work 6 and the latest epidemiological parameters reported for COVID-19, 11, 12 we compare the ability of individual quarantine and active monitoring to reduce the effective reproductive number ( ) of COVID-19 R e to below the critical threshold of one. While mass restrictions on movements within cities have been implemented during this outbreak and are sometimes referred to as quarantines, here we focus on the effectiveness of quarantine and active monitoring on an individual basis based on contact tracing."
34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"As described previously, 6 two settings are defined with respect to the feasibility of interventions (Table 1) . A high feasibility setting, presented as the main results, is defined as one where 90% of contacts are traced and are put under either quarantine or active monitoring within half a day on average. Contacts under active monitoring are monitored twice per day on average. A contact under quarantine has infectiousness reduced by 75% until symptoms emerge and prompt isolation. When symptoms emerge in a contact under quarantine or active monitoring, they are isolated in a setting that reduces infectiousness by 90%. Assuming perfect intervention performance is not possible, the high feasibility parameters represent an upper-bound on the expected ability to implement interventions based on contact tracing. A low feasibility setting loosens these assumptions to account for imperfect recall of who may be exposed, delays in identifying or locating contacts, infrequent or untrained monitoring of symptoms, and imperfect isolation resulting in nosocomial or other infections."
34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"The number of days an individual is under quarantine or active monitoring is measured as the time difference between when an individual is identified via contact tracing and when symptoms prompt isolation -which is immediate for an individual under quarantine and determined by the frequency of monitoring for an individual under active monitoring. We assume individuals under active monitoring or quarantine who are uninfected are followed for a duration of 14 days until clearance, consistent with recent interventions. 13 We calculated the expected percentage of infections that result from presymptomatic infectiousness in the absence of interventions as the sum total of expected secondary cases caused by an individual prior to symptom onset divided by the total force of infection for that individual times 100. This percentage equals 0% when symptom onset precedes infectiousness and equals 100% when the entire duration of infectiousness concludes prior to symptom onset."
34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"Interventions based on contact tracing, unlike mass interventions such as travel restrictions and social distancing, are targeted at individuals and therefore require resources --material and personnel --proportional to the number of cases traced: contact tracing requires detailed interview of case patients to learn of contacts and public health outreach to trace them; active monitoring of contacts may include twice-daily visits by healthcare workers or phone-based self-monitoring; 14 and individual quarantine of contacts requires private space, provision of essentials, and investment in enforcement. The burden of implementing active monitoring or individual quarantine grows quickly as a function of disease incidence and the fraction of traced contacts who are not infected. Assuming uninfected contacts (who never develop symptoms) are monitored or quarantined for 14 days before clearance, the number of uninfected contacts followed grows more quickly than truly infected contacts ( Figure 1 ). As the ratio of uninfected:infected contacts traced increases from 1:1 to 9:1, for example, the burden of uninfected contacts grows proportionally; note the actual ratio may be closer to 2,318:1, as recorded during SARS control in Taiwan where 24 (0.04%) of 55,632 quarantined contacts were found to be truly infected. 15 Depending on the ratio of uninfected to infected contacts traced, individual quarantine, even if initially effective, may soon become infeasible as the epidemic grows, and will need to be supplemented or deprioritized to focus resources on other interventions such as social distancing."
34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"In locations at an early stage of COVID-19, where resources allow investment in high-quality implementation of interventions based on contact tracing, the effectiveness of individual quarantine or active monitoring depends heavily on i) aspects of the disease, especially the assumed serial interval and timing of presymptomatic transmission, and ii) aspects of the setting including the fraction of contacts traced. Briefly, a shorter serial interval, larger window of presymptomatic transmission, poor quality interventions, and a small fraction of contacts traced all reduce the ability of either intervention to decrease transmission. Unless otherwise noted, the following results focus on high feasibility settings."
34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"The fraction of contacts traced is a particularly influential consideration. As the probability of tracing an infected contact decreases, more cases are able to transmit the infection without isolation and therefore, there is a linear increase in the average or across the R IQ R AM population ( Figure 5 ). Even with other operational parameters reflecting a high feasibility setting, at least three-quarters of contacts need to be traced and quarantined to reduce in the R e < 1 population in the absence of other interventions. For those individuals who are traced and placed under active monitoring or individual quarantine, however, the impact of the interventions at reducing onward transmission by that person remains effective. Even if only a small proportion of infected contacts are traced, therefore, the transmission chains those contacts could create can be prevented. The extent to which it is worth investing in imperfect contact tracing will depend on the rate of epidemic growth, which affects feasibility, and the other mix of interventions being considered."
34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"In a setting where the COVID-19 case count continues to grow, resources may be prioritized for scalable community interventions such as social distancing; however, close contacts such as family members of a patient may still undergo targeted interventions. In our modeling framework, social distancing functions synergistically by reducing the reproductive number of infected individuals in the community who are not in quarantine or isolation. If social distancing reduces the reproductive number to 1.25 (e.g., 50% of person-to-person contact is removed in a setting where , active monitoring of 50% of contacts can result in overall outbreak .5) R 0 = 2 control (ie, ) ( Figure 6 ). Tracing 10%, 50%, or 90% of contacts on top of social distancing R e < 1 resulted in a median reduction in of 3.2%, 15% and 33%, respectively, for active monitoring R e and 5.8%, 32%, and 66%, respectively, for individual quarantine."
34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, 16 we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically with social distancing."
34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"There may be such synergy in the data released by the WHO mission to China in February 2020. 17 In Guangdong, WHO reports that the proportion of fever clinic testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 declined from 0.47% on 30 January to 0.02% on 16 February, during a period of intensive social distancing interventions. 17 If one assumes that these social distancing interventions reduced transmission of nearly all infections that could cause attendance at a fever clinic, one might expect a lower total number of attendees, with proportionate declines in all infectious fever causes that are affected by social distancing. If one assumes that most fever causes are affected by social distancing, the declining proportion of SARS-CoV-2 among fever cases may reflect the benefits of interventions aimed specifically at this infection, which is to say case-based interventions like active monitoring, individual quarantine, and isolation."
34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"The effectiveness of individual quarantine versus active monitoring, targeted by contact tracing, heavily depends on the assumptions regarding the serial interval, the amount of transmission that occurs prior to symptom onset, and the feasibility setting. Under our fitted disease natural history parameters for serial interval scenario 1, with a shorter mean serial interval and hence substantial presymptomatic infectiousness, individual quarantine was considerably more effective than active monitoring at reducing onward transmission by an infected contact. To offset this relative benefit of individual quarantine compared to active monitoring, perverse incentives to avoid quarantine would have to be correspondingly larger. Both scenarios were fit using an incubation period with mean = 5.2 days among 451 lab-confirmed cases from Wuhan; 12 other recent estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 include a mean of 6.4 7 .

34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"Under both serial interval scenarios, in a low feasibility setting, the reproductive number was rarely brought below one under either individual quarantine or active monitoring, though a median reduction in the reproductive number of 21.0% and 13.6%, respectively for serial interval scenario 2, can still meaningfully slow the growth of an epidemic; for serial interval scenario 1, active monitoring resulted in only a 3% reduction in the reproductive number while individual quarantine resulted in a 17% reduction. If the epidemic continues to grow, however, the feasibility and social acceptability of quarantining individuals becomes a crucial consideration. In these circumstances, complementary interventions such as social distancing and pharmaceutical interventions may be needed if efficient contact tracing and rapid isolation are not readily achievable, regardless of the extent of presymptomatic transmission."

34137,Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19,"Assuming a reported serial interval of mean 4.8 days, the incremental benefit of individual quarantine over active monitoring was substantial as a result of faster dynamics and more presymptomatic transmission. However, using a SARS-like serial interval of mean 7.5 days, individual quarantine and active monitoring are similarly effective at controlling onward transmission in a high feasibility setting. The burden of placing uninfected contacts under individual quarantine can grow untenable due to a longer duration in quarantine before clearance (assumed 14 days) and a high ratio of uninfected contacts traced per truly infected contact. In such settings, resources may be prioritized for broader social distancing measures, and active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically. The sensitivity of these results to the estimated serial interval highlights the urgent need for better data to guide policy decisions."

Our results are shown in Fig. 3 . The black line shows the threshold for epidemic control: combined success rates in the region to the upper right of the black line are sufficient to reduce R to less than one. The x axis is the success rate of case isolation, which can be thought of either as the fraction of symptomatic individuals isolated, assuming perfect prevention of transmission on isolation, or the degree to which infectiousness of symptomatic individuals is reduced assuming all of them are isolated. The y axis is the success rate of contact tracing; similarly, this can be thought of as the fraction of all contacts traced, assuming perfectly successful quarantine upon tracing, or the degree to which infectiousness of contacts is reduced assuming all of them are traced. These results for intervention effectiveness, and their dependence on all parameters in our combined analysis, can be explored through the same involves the minimum imposition possible and that decisions in policy and practice are guided by three moral values: equal moral respect, fairness, and the importance of reducing suffering (28) . It is noteworthy that the algorithmic approach we propose avoids the need for coercive surveillance, since the system can have very large impacts and achieve sustained epidemic suppression, even with partial uptake.

Using mobile phones to measure infectious disease contact networks has been proposed previously (34-36). Considering our quantification of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we suggest that this approach, with a mobile phone App implementing instantaneous contact tracing, could reduce transmission enough to achieve R < 1 and sustained epidemic suppression, stopping the virus from spreading further. We have developed a web interface to explore the uncertainty in our modelling assumptions (25). This will also serve as an ongoing resource as new data becomes available and as the epidemic evolves."

34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"Evidence before this study COVID-19 is affecting many countries around the world. Multiple countries, states, and school districts are employing school closures as a non-pharmaceutical social distancing strategy. Support for school closures mostly comes from models and experience with influenza. Few studies explicitly consider the tradeoff between case reduction and disease burden with the potential loss of healthcare workers to child care obligations. We found only two studies that attempted to quantify the potential child care burden of school closures for healthcare workers. These analyses were coarse, and no studies have explicitly considered the tradeoff between reduced transmission and healthcare labor's role in cumulative mortality."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"Using current detailed data from the US Current Population Survey, we quantify the exposure of the US healthcare sector, occupations within the healthcare sector, and individual US states to unmet child care obligations for US healthcare workers in the event of a school closure. These obligations could compromise the ability of the US healthcare system to respond to COVID-19. We identify the parameter space where school closure could lead to a greater number of deaths from COVID-19 through healthcare labor force reductions. We find that the current best estimates of healthcare worker likely absenteeism to provide child care in the event of school closures imply great uncertainty to whether school closures will ultimately reduce COVID-19 mortality."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"Targeted pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 are likely months away. However, supportive measures by healthcare providers are important. Social distancing, including school closures, can limit COVID-19 cases. However, the evidence that the potential transmission reduction benefits of mandatory school closures exceed the costs of potentially imposing greater child care obligations on healthcare workers, thereby reducing the healthcare workforce, is not overwhelming. We provide the first explicit analysis of the school closure tradeoff between case reduction and labor force impact on patient survival probability. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker loss by 17.6% for school closures to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection probability of survival cannot increase by more than 2.4%; otherwise, school closures will lead reduce patient survival. Even if the only objective is to save lives, there is still a tradeoff associated with closing schools due to potential losses in healthcare labor force capacity."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"Covid-19's global spread is triggering a range of public health responses. School closures are some of the highest-profile social distancing measures employed to slow the spread of an infectious disease. Japan recently instituted a nationwide school closure, which drew a swift response from families scrambling to make alternative childcare arrangements. South Korea, Italy, and some US school districts have closed schools. School closures prevent contacts among children and reduce cases. But, there is a downside to closing schools, even if the only goal is saving lives during an epidemic. Closing schools can inadvertently cause child care shortages that strain the healthcare system. Lempel et al. estimated that the child care obligations associated with school closure could reduce key medical personnel by 6-19%. 1 Here, we use the recent years (2018-2020) of the US Current Population Survey to estimate the school closure induced child care obligations for the US healthcare labor force. Approximately 29% of US households with a healthcare worker have at least one school-aged child age 3-12, who requires child care. Child care obligations are especially high and relatively inflexible in households where a parent is a nurse or medical assistant. Understanding these tradeoffs are important in planning the public health response to COVID-19, because if the survival of infected patients is sufficiently sensitive to declines in the healthcare labor force, then school closures could increase deaths."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"The benefit from closing schools during an epidemic is to reduce transmission and new cases. Cauchemez et al. estimated that extended school closures in France could reduce H5N1 influenza cases by 13-17%. 2 Bayham et al. show that schools are likely places for transmission among US children. 3 However, Bayham et al. also show voluntary behavioral changes, without mandatory shutdowns, appeared to reduce cases of the 2009 H1N1 influenza on the order of 10-13%. In a systematic review, focused on influenza and school closures, Jackson et al. find some evidence that school closures are effective, but that the empirical evidence does not resolve how or when to close schools. 4 Furthermore, they find school closure mostly reduces infection in school children. Koh et al. do not find strong evidence that school closures prevent the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease. 5 Adda finds that while school closures do reduce incidence in France, the economic costs are large. 6 The benefits of school closure are often estimated relative to a baseline of no voluntary changes in behavior, but it is likely that the correct baseline for forcasting the school closure effect on COVID-19 includes other voluntary behavioral changes."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"The potential benefits of school closures must be balanced with the costs. Smith et al., Lempel, Epstein, and Hammond, and Adda analyze the economic impacts of school closures. 1, 6, 7 Schooling is one of the most important investments we make in our children's futures, and we do not have good estimates of how prolonged school closures influence drop-out rates and future earnings. This uncertainty makes a holistic assessment of tradeoffs challenging."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"Setting aside the economic costs and focusing on reducing mortality, school closures still create a tradeoff. Many healthcare workers must reduce time spent providing patient care, running diagnostic tests, and tracing contacts, and increase time caring for their own children. This tradeoff should not be ignored because the capacity to care for infected individuals and trace contacts directly influences the development of an epidemic, the survival of infected patients, and ultimately cummulative mortality from the pathogen."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"First, we highlight two pathways school closure can effect pathogen induced mortality. School closures, , can affect mortality via (1) reduction in cases and (2) a reduction in the healthcare labor force that treats sick patients and prevents mortality. While no pharmaceutical treatment is available, supportive measures are still important for patient survival. Define cumulative mortality as "

If there are no school closures, 0, then ⁄ 0. This implies mortality is . This model highlights the tradeoff between the case-reducing effect of school closures and the cost in terms of lost healthcare labor supply."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"Analyzing the net effect of school closures on mortality requires estimation of three factors that are not part of canonical epidemiological models. 8, 9 The first term is , which is the effect of school closure on the healthcare labor force and is between zero and one. The second term is , which is a first-order approximation of the life-saving (mortality-reducing) effect of healthcare providers on the probability of a patient dying from disease or disease-related complications. The third term is / , which is the reduction in cases associated with a school closure."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"The first term, , is rarely calculated. Lempel, Epstein, and Hammond provide a preliminary estimate for school closures in the US of a 6-19% reduction in the healthcare workforce. 1 To provide detailed estimates, we use data from the US Current Population Survey (CPS) to quantify the impact of school closures on healthcare labor supply, . The CPS is an ongoing monthly survey of approximately 60,000 US households jointly administered by the US Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics. We access the data via the Integrated Public Use Microdata. 10 We use the recent dataset, which includes information on just over 3 million individuals spread across 1.25 million households between January 2018-2020. The detailed data in the CPS allows us to characterize the family structure and likely withinhousehold childcare options for healthcare workers. It also enables us to describe the exposure to child care obligations for specific occupations within healthcare and across states. We calculate the share of healthcare provider households that are single parent, where a parent is defined to include head of household, opposite or same-sex spouse, partner or roommate, and an opposite or same-sex unmarried partner. We use the personal CPS sample weights for all calculations to ensure that the estimates are nationally representative."

34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"School closures may be especially challenging for single parents. 14.7% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides are single parents. Medical assistants (10.5%) and licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses (9.7%) are also more likely to be single parents than the healthcare average. Together this is 30% of the healthcare workforce, and is the segment most likely to be providing infection control for the elderly in nursing homes and other facilities."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"The exposure of the healthcare labor force to school closures is not homogeneous throughout the US (Appendix Table 1 ). How a policy trade-off plays out in one place may be different than another even if two locations experience a similar set of COVID-19 cases. That is, different places may have similar projected benefits from school closures, but different costs. The greatest share of the healthcare labor force with child care obligations is in Utah (35%), Louisiana (35%), and Missouri (34%), whereas the healthcare labor force in Washington DC (16%), Vermont (21%), and Massachusetts (24%) have the least child care obligations. However, household structures also vary. Therefore, if childcare obligations can be met by a non-working adult or older sibling, then South Dakota (21%), Oregon (20%), and Missouri (20%) are the most exposed states to school closure induced healthcare worker shortages. Washington DC (9%), New Mexico (10%), and New Jersey (11%) may be most able to cover their child care obligations. Louisiana (12%), Mississippi (11%), and Pennsylvania (10%) have the greatest fraction of single-parent healthcare worker households. These differences are likely an interaction of variations in state-level healthcare regulation, cultural, and demographic differences. This requires state and local health officials to consider the exposure of their own state (data available at https://github.com/jbayham/us_childcare_obligations) or region."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"Using the data on child care obligations provides a first estimate of potential reductions in the healthcare labor force during a school closure. This estimate can be combined with projections of the case reductions from school closures to identify the parameter space where estimates of 1 are important to inform whether school closures would reduce net mortality (Figure 2 ). If the is large, then the increase percent increase in the mortality rate is below , and closing schools saves lives. This is the case when school closures lead to many avoided cases, and few healthcare workforce effects. Conversely, if is near zero, then then it is likely that the percent increase in mortality exceeds and school closure increases the cumulative mortality. This is the case if the school closure reduces the labor force substantially but provides a relatively small reduction in cumulative cases. There is a band where 0 ≪ ≪ ∞, where whether or not closing schools saves lives depends on the value of , which is unknown."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"For the United States, and for most states within the US, the is not sufficently higher or lower to know which way a school closure will turnout without more information on . Consider an example that uses Cauchemez et al.'s (2008) estimate of a reduciton of cases of 15% from a school closure and assume baseline mortality to COVID-19 of 2%. Assume an epidemiological forcast without a school closure predicts 16,000 cases (about a 1/5 th of the cases currently reported in China), which implies 320 deaths (Italy has already reported 463 deaths with 9,172 cases). The school closure reduces cases to 13,600. The for this scenario is 0.176, with an associate 0.024. Therefore, the mortality rate after the closure must rise to at least 2.35% as a result of the 15% loss in the healthcare workforce in order to undo the benefits of school closures. This implies the percent increase in patient survival by avoiding a 15% reduction in the health workforce, an elasticity measuring healthcare worker ""prodcutivity,"" is 0.024. This means that doubling the healthcare workforce must not save more than 2.4% more patients or school closures could lead to more deaths. However, there is substantial variation across the country. For example, in South Dakota this elasticity is 1.7%, wheres in Washington DC it is 4.1%."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,An additional concern could be timing within an epidemic. School closure could spread out cases so as not to overwhelm the healthcare system. Cauchemez et al. estimates a reduction in peak prevalence of about 42%. This cannot raise the mortality per case in that period to less than 3.4% or an elasiticity of 9.9% for school closure to save lives.
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"What we know about social distancing policies is based largely on models of influenza, 4,13 where children are a vulnerable group. However, preliminary data on COVID-19 suggests that children are a small fraction of cases and may be less vulnerable than older adults. 14 If these early results hold-up, then the already uncertain transmission reduction benefits from school closures will be reduced relative to influenza. Conversely, school closures may be implemented earlier in COVID-19 outbreaks, which may lead to greater levels of prevented cases. Furthermore, school closures may lead to other adults staying home, which could reduce cases. These are all important questions when considering school closures."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"School closures do expose the healthcare labor force to increased child care obligations, likely reducing support for infected individuals, which is critical. We also do not know how much a reduction in the healthcare labor force, and in what occupations within healthcare, decreases the probability of COVID-19 patient survival. We do know that the segment of the healthcare work force most responsible for infection control in nursing homes is likely to be among the most highly impacted by school closure induced child care obligations. Given our reasonable estimates of case reductions from school closures, a measure of the increased mortality risk to COVID-19 patients from healthcare absenteeism to care for children is a critical, and to date unknown parameter. This analysis does not include non-COVID-19 mortality that could occur from other conditions if the US healthcare work force is reduced, but risk to these patients should also be considered when deciding about school closings."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"Minimizing the impact of the COVID-19 and saving lives requires clear thinking and weighing tradeoffs. There will likely be cases when closing schools is sensible. However, policymakers and the healthcare experts advising them need to understand that closing schools may have severe knock-on effects on the healthcare system and that there is substantial uncertainty about the effectiveness of school closures for preventing infection beyond school children and on the impact of reduction in the healthcare workforce on patient survival. In the United States, the healthcare system appears disproportionately exposed to school closure induced labor shortages, and the segment of that system that provides infection control in nursing homes even more so. Such potential healthcare workforce labor shortages should be a first-order consideration when considering the potential benefits and costs of school closures."

As a consequence, this measure leads to a change in mixing patterns in the population. The efficacy of social distancing of disease-aware individuals is described by the reduction in their contact rate which is varied 158 from 0% (no social distancing or zero efficacy) to 100% (full self-isolation or full efficacy)."
34257,Impact of self-imposed prevention measures and short-term government intervention on mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic,"Short-term government-imposed social distancing 160 Governments may decide to promote social distancing policies through interventions such as school and workplace 161 closures or by issuing a ban on large gatherings. These policies will cause a community-wide contact rate reduction, 162 regardless of the awareness status. Here, we assume that the government intervention is initiated if the number of 163 diagnosed individuals exceeds a certain threshold (10-1000 persons) and terminates after a fixed period of time (1-3 164 months). As such, the intervention is implemented early into the epidemic. The efficacy of government-imposed 165 social distancing is described by the reduction of the average contact rate in the population which ranges from 0% 166 (no distancing) to 100% (complete quarantine of the population). and of all individuals (government-imposed social distancing). We refer to these quantities as the efficacy of a 175 prevention measure and vary it from 0% (zero efficacy) to 100% (full efficacy) ( Table 1 ). The main analyses were 176 performed for two values of the rate of awareness spread that corresponded to scenarios of slow and fast spread 177 of awareness in the population (Table 1) . For these scenarios, the proportion of the aware population at the peak 178 of the epidemic was 40% and 90%, respectively. In the main analyses, government-imposed social distancing was 179 initiated when 10 individuals got diagnosed and was lifted after 3 months."

For example, a 3-month government 278 intervention imposing community-wide contact rate reduction that starts after tens to hundreds diagnoses in the 279 country can postpone the peak by about 7 months. If this intervention is combined with a self-imposed measure, 280 then the delay can be even longer (up to 10 months for handwashing with 30% efficacy).

34269,"If containment is not possible, how do we minimize mortality for COVID-19 and other emerging infectious disease outbreaks?","In the worst case, social distancing interventions are unable to interrupt sustained transmission and drive the epidemic to extinction, and strong interventions cannot be maintained long enough for new vaccines or therapeutics become available. In such a circumstance, if infection induces immunity in individuals -which seems to be the case for coronavirus infections in humans, such as for SARS and MERS (4-7) and likely also COVID-19 (8) -the best option is to apply interventions in a targeted manner. The goal is to slow down the spread of the disease such that new infections accrue slowly and do not overly strain the health care system, while allowing the number of susceptibles to drop until population (herd) immunity is achieved. The interventions can be slowly relaxed once susceptibles are close to the population immunity threshold, without risking a resurgent epidemic. The goal is to prevent any excess infections that would deplete susceptibles beyond the population level threshold, i.e., one wants to minimize the overshoot that typically occurs after an epidemic peak (9) . We discussed previously how to minimize the attack rate for a single population (9) and later extended it to multiple populations (10, 11 )."
34269,"If containment is not possible, how do we minimize mortality for COVID-19 and other emerging infectious disease outbreaks?","While school closures have proven to be an important means for delaying or reducing outbreaks (13, 14) , they come with large economic and societal costs, with generally an outsized impact on disadvantaged and vulnerable populations (15) ."
34269,"If containment is not possible, how do we minimize mortality for COVID-19 and other emerging infectious disease outbreaks?","As we discussed here, an additional consideration for COVID-19 is the fact that school closures might preferentially reduce infections in low risk groups (13, 16) , thus possibly shifting the burden of new infections that occur on the way to population immunity towards higher risk groups. It is however important to point out that school closures have secondary effects on contact patterns, e.g. requiring adults to stay home and thus changing their infection risk, or having grandparents care for their grand-children so that the parents can go to work. Thus, the exact implications of school closure in redistributing the risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among community members of different age groups remain uncertain. It is important to analyze the impact of different interventions using detailed models and empirical epidemiological studies, so that decision-makers can be adequately informed as they balance the need to slow transmission and to reduce mortality in the community."
34309,Demographic science aids in understanding the spread and fatality rates of COVID-19,"Going forward, demographically informed projections will better predict the COVID-19 burden and inform governments about targeted action. While population age structure is crucial for understanding the populations at the highest risk of mortality both across and within countries, it is also vital for understanding how much social distancing measures are required in each population to reduce the number of most critical cases and overload on the health system-aka ""flattening the curve""(13). Our illustrations show that countries with older populations will need to take more aggressive protective measures to stay below the threshold of critical cases that outstrip health system capacity. For these measures to be effective, special attention should be devoted to those population groups that are more at risk and patterns of intergenerational contact."
34309,Demographic science aids in understanding the spread and fatality rates of COVID-19,"The age structure of populations also suggests that the often squeezed ""sandwich"" generation of adults who care for both the old and young are an important link for mitigating transmission. Beyond introducing sick pay for those who need to self-isolate or care for family members, joint government and industry emergency policy measures should seek to counter family economic crises by delaying rent and mortgage payments for example, particularly for vulnerable and precarious workers. In the absence of economic security measures, this crucial sandwich generation may be less able to comply with policies that allow social distancing."

We note that social distancing interventions were invoked on Feb 23 rd in Lodi but until March 8 th in Bergamo, providing some empirical evidence for the potential of ""flattening the curve"" interventions."
34309,Demographic science aids in understanding the spread and fatality rates of COVID-19,"This stylized example may serve, once more, to show why while population age structure is crucial for understanding the populations at the highest risk of mortality both across and within countries, it is also important for understanding how much social distancing measures are required in each population to reduce the number of most critical cases and overload on the health system-aka ""flattening the curve."" 6 At this time of severe crisis, policy makers are called to define containment measures which are often difficult to sustain in the long run and which have immense repercussions in terms of socio-economic sustainability. For these measures to be effective, a special attention should be devoted to those population groups that are more at risk and to the strength of the connections across generations."

34376,High transmissibility of COVID-19 near symptom onset,"When the patient was laboratory-confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, a thorough epidemiological investigation including contact tracing was implemented by the outbreak investigation team of Taiwan CDC and local health authorities. The definition of a close contact was a person who did not wear appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) while having face-to-face contact with a confirmed case for more than 15 minutes after symptom onset. A contact was listed as a household contact if he/she lived in the same household with the index case, while those listed as family contacts were family members not living in the same household. For health care settings, close contact was defined by contacting an index case within two meters without appropriate PPE. Medical staff, hospital workers, and other patients in the same setting were included."
34376,High transmissibility of COVID-19 near symptom onset,"For high-risk populations, including household and hospital contacts, RT-PCR was performed regardless of symptoms.

For a family cluster, the index case was determined based on the temporality of symptom onset and review of the epidemiological link. A secondary case was excluded from the paired data if the date of onset was earlier than the date of exposure. Similarly, a close contact would be excluded if the date of last exposure was earlier than the date of symptom onset of the index case. For health care contacts, the date of exposure would be the date of admission if the exact date of exposure was not recorded."

We used the Bayesian hierarchical model to increase the stability in small-sample estimation. The exposure window period was defined as the time period from the first contact after symptom onset of the index case to the end of contact. For household contacts who lived with the index case, the day of first contact was set to be the day of symptom onset of the index case. Secondary clinical attack rate was calculated by dividing the number of symptom confirmed cases by the number of close contacts. We analyzed the dynamic change of secondary clinical attack rate after symptom onset in several ways. First, we categorized contacts based on the time of the initial exposure to the index case after index case's symptom onset (days 0-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, or >9). Second, we considered the whole exposure window period and fitted logistic regression models to estimate the piecewise period-specific odds ratio .

Of the 16 locally-acquired cases, three patients without any travel history were detected because of pneumonia of unknown etiology. The remaining 13 cases were secondary cases found through contact tracing. One of the 13 cases was excluded from subsequent transmission pair analysis because the documented day of exposure occurred after symptom onset of the secondary case. The median delay from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis was 5 days (range 0-12) among imported cases and 18.5 days (range 2-28) among locally-acquired cases ( Figure 1A ). All secondary cases had their first day of exposure within five days of the index case's symptom onset ( Figure 1B ). The presumed transmission trees were depicted in Figure 1C .

34417,A framework for identifying regional outbreak and spread of COVID-19 from one-minute population-wide surveys,"In Israel, the first infection of COVID-19 was confirmed on February 21st 2020, and in response, the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) instructed individuals who returned to Israel from specific countries, in which COVID-19 was spreading, to go into a 14-day home isolation. Since then, Israel has gradually imposed several measures aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus (Figure 2 ). On March 9th, 14-day home isolation was extended to individuals arriving from anywhere in the world starting from their date of arrival. Individuals that were in close contact, defined by being within approximately 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) from a COVID-19 patient for more than 15 minutes, were also instructed to be in home isolation for a similar time period. Symptomatic individuals with fever above 38 Celsius and respiratory symptoms (cough or shortness of breath) were instructed to stay home for two days after the fever has dropped down 3 . On March 11th, gatherings were limited to a maximum of 100 people and on March 15th, to 10 people, with attendees advised to keep a minimal distance of 2 m (6 ft 7 in) between one another. On March 19th, a national state of emergency was declared in the country, and Israeli citizens were banned from leaving their homes unless absolutely necessary with the exception of essential services that remained open. On March 20st, the first death of an Isreali citizen as a result of COVID-19 infection occurred."
34417,A framework for identifying regional outbreak and spread of COVID-19 from one-minute population-wide surveys,"Our tool has several potential applications. First, while it does not have the ability to diagnose individual cases of COVID-19 infections, it may help predict future spreading zones a few days before an outbreak occurs, with a high level of accuracy given a sufficient sample size. We currently provide a colormap of Israel by regions of symptoms ratio (Figure 3) , however, as the daily response rate will increase, enough data will be collected, enabling us to implement prediction models. These we hope would be leveraged by policy-makers to make informed decisions, by utilization of efficient regional prevention strategies rather than a universal approach. Second, it may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of prevention strategies implemented by public health organizations, such as the various social distancing measures which are currently being employed in many countries, including Israel. This can be done by measuring the effect of different strategies on reducing the number of symptomatic individuals. Third, it may help in understanding the clinical course of COVID-19 infection by tracking the dynamics of symptoms in the population over time."

Based on those findings, we develop a mathematical transmission model to disentangle how transmission is affected by age differences in the biology of COVID-19 infection and disease, and altered mixing patterns due to social distancing. In turn, we project the impact of social distancing and school closure on COVID-19 transmission."
34425,"Age profile of susceptibility, mixing, and social distancing shape the dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","The typical features of age-mixing patterns(5, 6) emerge in Wuhan and Shanghai when we consider the regular baseline weekday period ( Fig. 1A and 1D ). These features can be illustrated in the form of age-stratified contact matrices (provided as ready-to-use tables in the Supplementary Materials), where each cell represents the average number of contacts that an individual has with other individuals, stratified by age groups. The bottom left corner of the matrix, corresponding to contacts between school age children, is where the largest number of contacts is recorded. The contribution of contacts in the workplace is visible in the central part of the matrix, while the three diagonals (from bottom left to top right) represent contacts between household members. In contrast, for the outbreak period where strict social distancing was in place, much of the above-mentioned features disappears, essentially leaving the sole contribution of household mixing ( Fig. 1B and 1E ). In particular, contacts between school-age individuals are fully removed, as highlighted by differencing baseline and outbreak matrices ( Fig. 1C and  1F ). Overall, contacts during the outbreak mostly occurred at home with household members (94.1% in Wuhan and 78.5% in Shanghai), thus the outbreak contact matrix nearly coincides with the within-household contact matrix in both study sites and the assortativity by age feature observed for regular days almost entirely disappear (see Supplementary Materials)."
34425,"Age profile of susceptibility, mixing, and social distancing shape the dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","To understand the interplay between social distancing interventions, changes in human mixing patterns, and outbreak dynamics, we also need to consider potential age differences in susceptibility to infection. This is currently a topic of debate, as little information on the age profile of asymptomatic cases is available (7, 8) . To this aim, we analyzed contact tracing information from detailed epidemiological field investigations conducted by the Hunan CDC (Supplement). We calculated the age-specific relative risk of infection for close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 index cases. Briefly, all close contacts of COVID-19 cases reported in Hunan province were placed under medical observation for 14 days and were tested using real-time RT-PCR. Those who developed symptoms and tested positive were considered as symptomatic confirmed cases, while contacts who tested positive without exhibiting symptoms were considered as asymptomatic infections. The total of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was used to estimate the relative susceptibility to infection by age. The ratio of symptomatic cases to total infections was used to estimate the relative probability of developing symptoms (see Supplementary Material). We found age differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection, where young individuals (aged 0-14 years) had a lower risk of infection than individual ages 65 years and over (OR=0.41 (95%CI: 0.18-0.93), p-value=0.026). There was a weak non-significant trend towards lower susceptibility in middle-aged adults, relative to seniors (OR=0.76, 95%CI: 0.46-1.24, Tab. 2). These findings are in contrast with a previous study in Shenzhen, where susceptibility to infection did not change with age (7). Moreover, we found that the relative probability of developing symptoms also increased with age, however the difference was not statistically significant (Tab. 2)."
34425,"Age profile of susceptibility, mixing, and social distancing shape the dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","Based on the estimated age-specific mixing patterns and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, we developed a SIR model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and tested the impact of social distancing measures on disease dynamics. In the model, the population is divided into three epidemiological categories: susceptible, infectious, and removed (either recovered or deceased individuals), stratified by 14 age groups. Susceptible individuals can become infectious after contact with an infectious individual according to the estimated age-specific susceptibility to infection. Because we did not see age differences in the probability of developing symptoms upon infection, we assumed equal infectivity across all age groups. The rate at which contacts occur is determined by the estimated mixing patterns in each age group."
34425,"Age profile of susceptibility, mixing, and social distancing shape the dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","On the other hand, if we consider a scenario where social distancing measures are implemented early on, as the new virus emerges, the estimated R0 remains under the threshold and thus the epidemic cannot take off in either location. Furthermore, we estimate that the magnitude of interventions implemented in Wuhan and Shanghai would have been enough to bring the reproduction number below 1.0 for baseline R0 up to ~7 in Wuhan and ~11.5 in Shanghai (Fig. 2A) . We also conduct sensitivity analyses on assumptions about the susceptibility profile of infections, since there is still uncertainty about this parameter (see Supplementary Material). Our conclusions are robust to assuming equal susceptibility in all age groups."
34425,"Age profile of susceptibility, mixing, and social distancing shape the dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","Finally, armed with a carefully calibrated model, we turn to assess the impact of a preemptive mass school closure. We used the same estimates of relative susceptibility to infection by age as in our main analysis (see Supplementary Material for a sensitivity analysis assuming equal susceptibility to infection). We considered two different contact pattern scenarios, based on data from Shanghai: contacts estimated during vacations period (6) and contacts estimated during regular weekdays, after all contacts occurring in school settings have been removed (6) . Either one of these scenarios represent a simplification of a school closure strategy as during vacations children can still attend additional education, while removing all contacts in the school setting does not take into account that, for instance, parents may need to leave work to take care of children. We estimated that limiting contact patterns to those observed during vacations would interrupt transmission for baseline R0 up to 1.5 (Fig. 2C) . Removing all school contacts would do the same for baseline R0 up to 1.2. If we apply these interventions to a COVID-19 scenario, assuming a baseline R0 of 2 -3.5, we can achieve a noticeable decrease in infection attack rate and peak incidence, and a delay in the epidemic, but transmission is not interrupted (Fig. 2D ). For instance, for baseline R0=2.5 and assuming a vacation mixing pattern, the peak daily incidence is reduced by about 57%. In the corresponding scenario where school contacts are removed, we estimate a reduction of about 20%. Overall, school-based policies are not sufficient to entirely prevent a COVID-19 outbreak but they can have a significant impact on disease dynamics, and hence on hospital surge capacity."
34425,"Age profile of susceptibility, mixing, and social distancing shape the dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","This study suffers from several limitations. First, the estimated mixing patterns for a regular weekday in Wuhan may be affected by recall bias since contacts were assessed retrospectively. For Shanghai, we relied on a survey conducted in December 2017 -May 2018, using the same design as the one conducted during the outbreak period, thus avoiding recall bias. It is also important to note that changes in contact patterns were measured in a context where social distancing was applied together with rapid isolation of infected individuals (including suspected cases) and quarantine of close contacts for 14 days. Only a small portion of the population in the two study sites was affected by contact tracing and quarantine, thus having little to no effect on the average contact patterns of the general population. However, in reconstructing the observed epidemics in Wuhan and Shanghai, it is not possible to separate the effects of case-based strategies from population wide social distancing. In our simulation model, we estimated the effect of social distancing alone; combining social distancing and case-based interventions would have a synergistic effect to further reduce transmission. Further, our estimates of age differences in susceptibility to infection and probability of developing symptoms are based on active testing of contacts of 57 primary confirmed cases. These data suffer from the usual difficulties inherent to identifying epidemiological links and index cases.

34425,"Age profile of susceptibility, mixing, and social distancing shape the dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","While the age patterns of contacts were not significantly different between the two study locations during the COVID-19 outbreak period, these patterns may not be fully representative of other locations in China and abroad, where social distancing measures may differ. Modeling results may possibly be underestimating the effect of social distancing interventions as our results account for a decreased number of contacts but ignore the impact of increased awareness of the population, which may have also affected the type of social interactions (e.g., increased distance between individuals while in contact, or use of face mask (16, 17) ). Finally, our school closure simulations are not meant to formulate a full intervention strategy, which would require identification of epidemic triggers to initiate closures and evaluation of different durations of intervention (5) . Nonetheless, our modeling exercise provides an indication of the possible impact of a nation-wide preemptive strategy on the infection attack rate and peak incidence. To generalize these findings to other contexts, location-specific age-mixing patterns and population structures should be considered."

The schools and universities closed in the first week and in the second week the effective reproduction number decreased to 4.5. In the second week the working time reduced and effective reproduction number decreased to 4.29 from 13 th day to 16 th . Comparing to the other researches, the results showed that In the third and fourth weeks people decided to stay at home spontaneously and the government reduced the working time. The effective reproduction number significantly decreased to 2.1 between March 6, 2020 to March 18, 2020, which indicates that social distancing and prevention of travelling is needed to control the outbreak.

This response was in contrast to the situation which occurred in 2002/3 with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic, as with the current coronavirus also originating from an animal reservoir in China, where the SARS coronavirus had spread widely before measures were effected to contain it.2 Given the resulting worldwide spread of COVID-19 public health authorities require guidance on how best to mitigate its spread, to reduce the peak in daily case numbers, and so lessen the number of critically ill cases requiring hospitalization. We present results from an extensive model-based analysis of the effectiveness of social distancing interventions, the only measures currently available in the absence of vaccines and antiviral drug treatments, to help inform health authorities."

These parameter settings gave us an unmitigated epidemic baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing (SD) strategies. Model outputs obtained by running the simulation software for the duration of an infectious disease outbreak gave the infection history of each individual in the modelled community. This data was used to determine the total number of infectious individuals, where and when infection occurs, and may be used to determine the resulting health burden in terms of hospitalisations and deaths.14,19 The data generated by running the simulation model software provided data on the rate of growth in cases, the magnitude of the peak number of cases and resulting impact on the hospital system, the time to reach the peak, and duration of the outbreak."

The difference in cases allows for quantification of intervention effectiveness, and the benefit represented as a reduction in infections and thus symptomatic cases and deaths."
34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"We have assumed the transmission characteristics of COVID-19 using early data from the outbreak in Wuhan, prior to social distancing interventions.3 These are as follows: a basic reproduction number R0 of 2·2; an incubation period averaging 5·5 days, from infection to symptom emergence (if any); a latent period averaging 4·5 days, from infection to becoming infectious; an infectious period averaging 3.0 days, the first day being asymptomatic; and a 20% asymptomatic rate, that is, 20% of infectious individuals show no symptoms and are not classed as cases. These data are contained in Table 1 . At the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic reliable age-specific symptomatic attack rates were unavailable and we thus assumed transmission between different ages of individuals occurs similarly. In addition, we evaluated social distancing effectiveness with a higher asymptomatic setting, of 35%."

This mobility mechanism allowed us to model changing contact patterns, with possible virus transmission occurring in these contact locations, and also in the wider community, including at weekends. The model represents the individual-to-individual contact patterns in as much detail as data sources provide, to accurately describe how the movement of individuals allows virus transmission to spread over a geographic region. This level of detail is critical for modelling social distancing interventions, whose aim is to minimize person-to-person contact patterns and consequential virus transmission.

34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"Assumptions regarding feasible social distancing measures made in prior pandemic influenza modelling studies are also applicable in the novel coronavirus context.2,3 These may be briefly explained as follows. We consider both moderate workplace and community contact reductions, as well as much higher reductions for these two mitigation strategies. School closure: when schools and further education institutions are closed students have contact with household members during the daytime and also have contact in the community. Workplace non-attendance: 50% of all persons in the workforce are absent, have contact in the home in the daytime and still having contact in the wider community. Increased home isolation of cases: 90% of adults and 100% of children withdraw to the home on becoming ill i.e. are symptomatic and only have contact with household members; this is an increase from the baseline assumption of 50% adults and 90%"
34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"We also evaluated strengthening these measures, by increasing workplace non-attendance to 90% and reducing community contact by 50% or 70%. These higher contact reductions may correspond to the social distancing measures taken in Hubei Province, China. To provide information on when social distancing measures should be activated, we further analysed the impact which delayed activation has on the epidemic growth rate."
34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"While the aim of vaccination is to reduce the reproduction number R0 of an outbreak to less than 1.0 and an outbreak will eventually fade out, the situation with COVID-19 is different. As with the SARS outbreak in 2003 no vaccine is available,20 and the population has no immunity at the outset. Reliance must be made on robust social distancing interventions, contact tracing and early isolation of diagnosed cases. The aim of social distancing interventions in the current situation is to slow down transmission and reduce the growth rate in case numbers. This approach aims to lessen the daily pressure on health care personnel and hospital facilities, such as intensive care beds, and to lower mortality rates."

These involved 9 alternative social distancing mitigation strategies interventions and 11 activation delays, between zero to ten weeks."
34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"The highest reduction in the infection attack rate is achieved by the rapid activation of all available social distancing interventions, and with the highest rates of compliance. With an activation delay of up to six weeks from arrival of the first infectious cases into the modelled community, the continued use of all four social distancing interventions with 90% workplace non-attendance and a 70% reduction in community-wide contact resulted in a reduction of the infection rate from 66% to less than 1%, see Table 2 . Similarly, all four social distancing interventions with lower workplace non-attendance (50%) and a lower reduction in community-wide contact (by 30%) and activation delays of up to ten weeks also held the infection rate to below 10%. With these ""very high"" and ""high"" social distancing measures activated an outbreak can be substantially contained."

With no significant activation delay, the most effective single measure is the 70% reduction in community-wide contact. This reduces the infection attack rate to approximately a third, from 180,000 to 64,000 (Table 3 ) and from 66% of the population down to 24% (Table 2) . Lower rates of community contact reduction, by 50% and 30% are found to be significantly less effective.

With all measures activated simultaneously, and 50% workplace non-attendance and a 30% reduction in community contact, a local epidemic can be halted. Even with an activation delay of eight weeks this combined strategy reduces the overall number of infections from 180,000 to 12,000. With a more rigorous intervention strategy involving school closure, increased case isolation, 90% workplace nonattendance and a 70% reduction in community-wide contact an even greater reduction may be achieved.

34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"The ability to significantly reduce transmission by combining rigorous social distancing interventions together, even applying them after a significant period beyond the initial arrival of infectious cases into the community, is illustrated in Figure 1 . Here, the simulation results have been scaled to Perth, Western Australia, which has a population of approximately 2·2 million. This figure presents results from the simulation model assuming a ten week delay in activating social distancing measures following arrival of initial cases into the community. It may be seen that the two combined measures (in green) are able to significantly reduce the daily number of cases, with the more robust intervention (dashed green) being the most effective. Nevertheless, all single measures are seen to reduce the epidemic peak, with all school and further education establishment closure being the least effective and the 70% reduction in community-wide contact the most effective single social distancing measure."

Figure 1 illustrates the growth in cases prior to intervention activation (the increasing green curve) and how the activation of the robust combined strategies at week ten rapidly reduces the number of daily cases, from approximately day 79 onwards. All individual interventions are seen to lower the peak daily number of cases, with a 70% reduction in community cases (CCR70, long dashed blue) being the most effective in reducing the peak, followed by increased case isolation (CI, purple). A less ""strict"" community contact reduction of 50% (CCR50, dotted blue), 90% workplace absenteeism (WN90, dashed yellow), and 30% community contact reduction (CCT30, solid blue) are single interventions which are increasingly less effective in reducing the daily infection peak. Figures 2 and 3 present the epidemic curves for infectious cases with one and five week activation delays, respectively. For these short activation delay scenarios both combined intervention strategies are effective in preventing an epidemic occurring, both green lines are flat. However, this assumes that these robust intervention strategies are continued indefinitely. 70% communitywide contact reduction is the most effective single intervention measure and increasing case isolation and a 50% reduction in community contact are also seen to be highly effective in reducing the growth in case numbers and delaying the epidemic peak."

Figure 4 extracts the daily elderly case infection rate from the same model-generated infection dataset used in Figure 2 , that is with a 1 week delay on social distancing activation. Figure 4 demonstrates how robust social distancing combining all social distancing measures (green lines) may reduce infections in the elderly to almost zero. A 70% reduction in community contact (dashed blue line) is a single intervention measure predicted to reduce the maximum daily infections in this age group to ~200, from ~3000 in an unmitigated scenario.

In addition, one involves at 30% reduction in community contact and a 50% reduction in workplace attendance (CCR30, WN50) as in the above figure. The other is a more robust scenario, with community contact reduction strengthened to a 70% reduction, and workplace closure resulting in a 90% non-attendance rate (CCR70, WN90).

34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"The four scenarios, all with a 10 week delay in activation, can be seen to significantly lessen daily case numbers in the initial phase, reducing them rapidly from around day 73. Note that the orange and yellow curves overlay the dark blue and grey curves at first, from week 11. The pale blue curve indicates the pattern of daily cases with no social distancing in place, involving both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases."
34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"All four scenarios predict a rapid gain in daily cases after interventions cease, 6 or 8 weeks after activation, under strong (CCR reduced by 30% and WN by 50%) and very strong (CCR reduced by 70% and WN by 90) social distancing. It can be seen that case numbers increase again, as we would expect, with the very strong interventions (grey and yellow) having a flatter and longer epidemic curve."
34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"It is apparent from results generated by our simulation model that both the timing and strength of social distancing measures have a substantial effect in reducing the number of infected individuals in a pandemic situation. In reality, it is unlikely that the initial arrival of infectious cases into a community would be identified in a matter of a few days. This suggests that delays may be expected if waiting for diagnosis to occur before activation of mitigating measures. The modelling results suggest that even with a significant delay in invoking mitigation strategies, 10 weeks in the case of data presented in Figure 1 , this delay and consequential growth in case numbers may be countered by the scale of interventions adopted, by combining multiple robust social distancing measures."
34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"The timing of activation of social distancing measures is a challenge facing public health authorities, balancing what needs to be done with what is feasible, and this will vary between countries. Our modelling gives initial guidance on the relative benefit of a range of mitigation strategies. As the COVID-19 pandemic develops more subtle strategies will need to be evaluated, such as the phased introduction of additional measures if it is found that existing strategies are ineffective in reducing daily case numbers. Similarly, modelling will be required to determine optimal strategies to phase the ending of interventions once the epidemic peak has passed. Models such as that presented here will have a key role in analysing these evolving situations."
34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"The results indicate that two separate social distancing measures are highly effective, case isolation and a 70% reduction in community-wide contact. Both of these measures may be strengthened further. Given we assumed that only cases are isolated, not the whole family, there is scope to increase the effectiveness of that strategy. The 70% community contact reduction intervention may also be further strengthened to a 90% reduction if required."
34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"Our modelling suggests that school closure is the least effective single social distancing measure considered, however it is highly disruptive as adults are needed to care for younger children. Its moderate effectiveness arises from our assumption that children still have contact in the wider community when schools are closed. This suggests that combining school closure with even a 30% reduction in community-wide contact will be significantly more effective."

34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"Future modelling should evaluate social distancing interventions which might be more applicable in countries such as the UK, other European countries, Australia or the USA. Questions that need answering include which interventions are feasible in a given setting and how effective would these be? Our modelling has assumed that interventions are held until a vaccine or treatment option appears, which may not be feasible, with really strong measures possibly leading to compliance fatigue after being held for long periods of time. To address this, modelling may be used to evaluate repeated cycles of starting and stopping interventions, given that we have demonstrated that starting and stopping robust combined interventions can significantly flatten the epidemic curve."
34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"The COVID-19 transmission characteristics assumed in our model produced an unmitigated infection rate of 66%, which included both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and a basic reproduction number of 2.2. Higher or lower R0 settings will affect case numbers under all the social distancing interventions considered. In the absence of definitive data on the proportion of infections which are asymptomatic, we assumed a 20% asymptomatic proportion though the actual percentage may be larger. Similarly, if the infectious period is longer than the 3 days assumed, the same caveat applies. However, our sensitivity analyses indicate that changing the underlying model parameters to reflect these modifications does not affect the relative effectiveness of the social distancing measures."
34504,Simulation-based Estimation of the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran,"of March 20th, 2020. Our estimate for cumulative cases of infection until that date is 916,000 (90% CI: 508K, 1.5M), and for total death is 15,485 (90% CI: 8.4K, 25.8K). These numbers are significantly (more than one order of magnitude) higher than official statistics. The trajectory of the epidemic until the end of June could take various paths depending on the impact of seasonality and policies targeting social distancing. In the most optimistic scenario for seasonal effects, depending on policy measures, 1.6 million Iranians (90% CI: 0.9M-2.6M) are likely to get infected, and death toll will reach about 58,000 cases (90% CI: 32K-97K), while in the more pessimistic scenarios, death toll may exceed 103,000 cases (90% CI: 56K-172K)."
34504,Simulation-based Estimation of the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran,"In this paper we provided a more sobering picture of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran using a dynamic model that goes beyond official statistics. Integrating data from various sources we suspect the current official statistics are at least an order of magnitude below actual spread of the epidemic, and even in optimistic scenarios the burden of disease will be large and lasting for many months. Implementing, and sustaining, strong policies that target social distancing offers the main hope for containing the epidemic."
34504,Simulation-based Estimation of the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran,"The gap between official statistics and our estimates may be due to various complications in measurement as well as policy choices. The availability of testing infrastructure has been a major bottleneck for detecting cases in Iran. Citizens with suspicious symptoms have had no easy way for getting tested; most tests are conducted on hospitalized patients, require specific authorization, and are processed in a few centralized labs adding significant delays to the process. Not only mild cases are missed, but also many critical patients have been unable to access the care they need due to hospital congestion. The fact that majority of cases have mild symptoms similar to flu (Wu and McGoogan 2020) adds to the risk of under-counting even if the testing capacity was ample. In fact many mild or moderately sick patients may have preferred to stay home than risk being infected upon visiting a congested hospital, further reducing demand for testing."
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"In the absence of a vaccine, social distancing remains the only option to slow down the spread of the disease and arrest potential mortality. Governments around the world are now enacting aggressive policies, including ""shelter in place"" and emergency closures of all nonessential services, which carry severe economic and social consequences. For example, in the last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and the White House have recommended extreme social distancing in order to slow down the current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (5). However, these measures are less aggressive than what has been put in place elsewhere (6) . There is still a great deal of uncertainty as to how strong social distancing recommendations must be or how long they must last. Importantly, national and regional social distancing policies are likely to impact individual cities differently."

A larger R ∼ N δ leads to more extensive epidemics (larger S ∞ /S 0 = S ∞ /N ) in the relative sense where a greater proportion of the susceptible population is affected. With values of R > 1, which are larger in larger cities, we expect epidemics to be more extensive because larger fractions of the population will be exposed to the disease. A final point centers on the fraction of the population that must be removed from the susceptible class when R > 1 to stop the outbreak. This is often called the vaccination rate, p R , which is equally relevant in the context of social distancing (as only the means of the intervention and its duration differ). In the SIR model, this is simply p R = 1 − 1/R, which shows that as cities get larger the distancing rate must also increase."
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"These observations have a number of implications that might inform evolving national, regional, and local responses to the outbreak of COVID-19. First, it is particularly important for larger cities to act quickly to contain this outbreak. Second, social distancing will impact cities differently based on city size. From the perspective of containing the outbreak, larger cities require more aggressive social distancing policies, corresponding to a larger p R . At the same time, once the outbreak is contained it might be possible to relax social distancing policies in smaller cities first, allowing a faster return to normal life and economic activity compared to more populous cities."
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"Because of their higher network density, insufficient social distancing in larger or typically more connected cities may lead to bigger outbreaks and to the creation of reservoirs for the disease, which can continue to create introductions elsewhere. These dynamics may also play out within cities, as communities in which people interact more densely from the perspective 5 .

34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"A key metric for the success of curve-flattening strategies is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. Modeling studies (7) and experience from the Wuhan outbreak (2) indicate that critical care capacities even in high-income countries can be exceeded many times over if distancing measures are not implemented quickly or strongly enough. To keep critical care capacities from being overwhelmed, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary (7) . However, the necessary duration, frequency, and intensity of this distancing remains unclear in the presence of seasonality. To alleviate these problems, approaches to increase critical care capacity have included rapid construction or repurposing of hospital facilities and consideration of increased manufacturing and distribution of ventilators (8) (9) (10) (11) ."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"The duration of social distancing measures needed to maintain control of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the context of seasonally varying transmission remains unclear, as does the impact of increasing critical care capacity on the overall trajectory of the outbreak. To address these unknowns, here we assessed the transmission of SARS-Cov-2 through 2021 using a mathematical model with seasonal transmission forcing."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"We used the open critical care capacity of the United States, 0.89 free beds per 10,000 adults, as a benchmark for critical care demand (2) . We simulated epidemic trajectories based on an epidemic establishment time of 11 March 2020. We simulated social distancing by reducing R0 by a fixed proportion, which ranged between 0 and 60%, on par with the reduction in R0 achieved in China through intense social distancing measures (3) . We assessed 'one-time' social distancing interventions, for which R0 was reduced by up to 60% for a fixed duration of time (up to 20 weeks) starting two weeks after epidemic establishment. We also assessed intermittent social distancing measures, for which social distancing was turned 'on' when the prevalence of infection rose above a threshold and 'off' when it fell below a second, lower threshold, with the goal of keeping the number of critical care patients below 0.89 per 10,000 adults. An 'on' threshold of 37.5 cases per 10,000 people achieved this goal in both the seasonal and non-seasonal cases with wintertime R0 = 2. We chose 10 cases per 10,000 adults as the 'off' threshold. We performed a sensitivity analysis around these threshold values (Figures S2-S3 ) to assess how they affected the duration and frequency of the interventions. Finally, we assessed the impact of doubling critical care capacity (and the associated on/off thresholds) on the frequency and overall duration of the period social distancing measures."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"We evaluated the impact of one-time social distancing efforts of varying effectiveness and duration on the peak and timing of the epidemic with and without seasonal forcing. When transmission is not subject to seasonal forcing, one-time social distancing measures reduce the epidemic peak size (Figure 1, Figure S4 ). Under all scenarios, there was a resurgence of infection when the simulated social distancing measures were lifted. However, longer and more stringent social distancing did not always correlate with greater reductions in epidemic peak size. In the case of a 20-week period of social distancing with 60% reduction in R0, for example, the resurgence peak size is nearly the same as the peak size of the uncontrolled epidemic: the social distancing is so effective that virtually no population immunity is built. The greatest reductions in peak size come from social distancing intensity and duration that divide cases approximately equally between peaks (12) ."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"For simulations with seasonal forcing, the post-intervention resurgent peak could exceed the size of the unconstrained epidemic (Figure 2 , Figure S5 ), both in terms of peak prevalence and in terms of total number infected. Strong social distancing maintains a high proportion of susceptible individuals in the population, leading to an intense epidemic when R0 rises in the late autumn and winter. None of the one-time interventions was effective in maintaining the prevalence of critical cases below the critical care capacity."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Intermittent social distancing can prevent critical care capacity from being exceeded (Figure 3 , Figure S6 ). Due to the natural history of infection, there is an approximately 3-week lag between the start of social distancing and the peak critical care demand. When transmission is seasonally forced, summertime social distancing can be less frequent than when R0 remains constant at its maximal wintertime value throughout the year. The length of time between distancing measures increases as the epidemic continues, as the accumulation of immunity in the population slows the resurgence of infection. Under current critical care capacities, however, the overall duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic could last into 2022, requiring social distancing measures to be in place between 25% (for wintertime R0 = 2 and seasonality, Figure  S3A ) and 70% (for wintertime R0 = 2.5 and no seasonality, Figure S2C ) of that time."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Increasing critical care capacity allows population immunity to be accumulated more rapidly, reducing the overall duration of the epidemic and the total length of social distancing measures (Figure 3 C-D) . While the frequency and duration of the social distancing measures is similar between the scenarios with current and expanded critical care capacity, the epidemic concludes by July 2022 and social distancing measures can be fully relaxed by early-to mid-2021, depending again on the degree of seasonal forcing of transmission (Figure 3 C-D) . We anticipate that SARS-CoV-2 will then circulate seasonally with winter peaks in subsequent years (4) ."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"A single period of social distancing will not be sufficient to prevent critical care capacities from being overwhelmed by the COVID-19 epidemic, because under any scenario considered it leaves enough of the population susceptible that a rebound in transmission after the end of the period will lead to an epidemic that exceeds this capacity. This resurgence could be especially intense if it coincides with a wintertime rise in R0. Intermittent social distancing can maintain the prevalence of critical COVID-19 illness within current capacities, but this strategy could prolong the overall duration of the epidemic into 2022. Increasing critical care capacities would substantially reduce the overall duration of the epidemic while ensuring adequate care for the critically ill."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Our findings agree with observational and modelling studies (2,7) that find that early implementation of strong social distancing is essential for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and that, in the absence of the development of new therapies or preventative measures, such as aggressive case finding and quarantining (13) , intermittent distancing measures may be the only way to avoid overwhelming critical care capacity while building population immunity. The observation that strong social distancing can lead to especially large resurgences agrees with data from the 1918 influenza pandemic in the United States (14), in which the size of the autumn 1918 peak of infection was inversely associated with that of a subsequent winter peak after interventions were no longer in place."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"To implement an effective intermittent social distancing strategy, it will be necessary to carry out widespread surveillance to monitor when the prevalence thresholds that trigger the beginning or end of distancing have been crossed. Without such surveillance, critical care bed availability might be used as a proxy for prevalence, but this metric is far from optimal since the lag between distancing and peak critical care demand could lead to frequent overrunning of critical care resources. Under some circumstances, intense social distancing may be able to reduce the prevalence of COVID-19 enough to warrant a shift in strategy to contact tracing and containment efforts, as has occurred in many parts of China (13, 15, 16) . Still, countries that have achieved this level of control of the outbreak should prepare for the possibility of substantial resurgences of infection and a return to social distancing measures, especially if seasonal forcing contributes to a rise in transmissibility in the winter."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Treatments or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 would reduce the duration and intensity of social distancing required to maintain control of the epidemic. Treatments could reduce the proportion of infections that require critical care and could reduce the duration of infectiousness, which would both directly and indirectly (through a reduction in R0) reduce the demand for critical care resources. A vaccine would accelerate the accumulation of immunity in the population, reducing the overall length of the epidemic and averting infections that might have resulted in a need for critical care. Still, the development and widespread adoption of pharmaceutical interventions will take months at best, so a period of sustained or intermittent social distancing will almost certainly be necessary."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"The model we have used is deterministic and assumes that the population is well-mixed, meaning that each person has an equal probability of coming into potentially infectious contact with every other person. Population structure can reduce outbreak peak size (17) , so the modeling here may be interpreted as worst-case scenarios. The timing and duration of the interventions will likely need to be tailored geographically due to variation in epidemic timing, seasonal forcing, and critical care capacities. Deterministic models also cannot capture the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 elimination. However, given the widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we believe that elimination is unlikely. Re-introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from locations with ongoing outbreaks would be sufficient to initiate sustained local transmission again (18) . We have also assumed that SARS-CoV-2 infection is permanently immunizing, since our focus was on the initial pandemic period. There is insufficient serological data to assess the amount of immunity that exists to SARS-CoV-2 and its duration. If SARS-CoV-2 immunity wanes rapidly, social distancing measures may need to be extended longer. However, if there are many undocumented asymptomatic infections that lead to immunity (19) , less social distancing may be required. Social distancing strategies will require further evaluation as longitudinal serological studies clarify the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-Cov-2."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"One-time social distancing efforts will push the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak into the autumn, potentially exacerbating the load on critical care resources if there is increased wintertime transmissibility. Intermittent social distancing can maintain critical care demand within current thresholds, but widespread surveillance will be required to time the distancing measures correctly and avoid overshooting critical care capacity. New therapeutics, vaccines, or other interventions such as aggressive contact tracing and quarantine -impractical now in many places but more practical once case numbers have been reduced and testing scaled up (20)could alleviate the need for stringent social distancing to maintain control of the epidemic. In the absence of such interventions, surveillance and intermittent distancing may need to be maintained into 2022, which would present a substantial social and economic burden. To shorten the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and ensure adequate care for the critically ill, increasing critical care capacity and developing additional interventions are urgent priorities."

34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,"With 565 confirmed cases (3) and still counting, COVID-19 now looks certain to cause sustained local transmission within Australia. Therefore, at this time it is reasonable to reflect on the value of travel restrictions imposed to date, and to consider the benefit of ongoing travel restrictions in the coming weeks and months, when community transmission starts to increase. We answer these questions using OAG-travel data and a meta-population model for disease transmission. First we examine the counterfactuals: what would have happened had the travel ban from Wuhan/China not been implemented. Similarly we examine the impacts of bans to other emerging epicentres including Iran, Italy, and South Korea. We then examine the impacts for the future and compare the cases expected through community transmission, and from importation over the next 2 months."
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,We simulate our stochastic meta-population model 1000 times to generate estimates of: the cumulative number of imported cases in each country (see Figures 1 and 2 ) and the projected epidemic curves in Australia both in the presence and absence of travel bans.
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,"We first validate our model by comparing estimates of imported cases provided by the model simulations with reported values as at January 31 st 2020 (see Figure 1 ). We find that our metapopulation model accurately reproduces reported observations for many countries -in particular, Australia -however estimates become increasingly unreliable for countries with significant migration volumes with China. Variation between model predictions and observation can be partially accounted for by stochastic variation and potential under-reporting. 2020, our model estimates that Australia would have received over 70 imported cases of COVID-19 compared with the 15 cases that were actually observed. This represents a 79% reduction in expected cases, and similar to what was estimated elsewhere (6) . However, the introduction of travel bans on international passengers arriving from Iran, South Korea and Italy, does not lead to a significant decrease in the expected COVID-19 importation count to Australia. One reason for this is that the much lower prevalence in these countries compared with China. Furthermore, Italy had already placed itself on lock down by the time Australia enforced restrictions on travelers arriving from Italy. Finally, we explored the effects of travel ban and other intervention -such as reducing contacts to lower the basic reproduction number -on delaying widespread local transmission within Australia. We found that without travel bans, Australia would have experienced local transmission as early as Jan 15 and possibly have become the Pacific epicenter. However, with the China travel ban in place, this delayed the widespread occurrence of local transmission by approximately one month (see Figure  3 ). Thus, if interventions are in place that can reduce the reproduction number to 1.73 (in-line with China's response) local transmission can be further delayed by another 5 weeks (Figure 3 ). Overlaying the simulation prediction with observed local cases in Australia suggesting more needs to be done to slow down the virus in Australia."
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,"After an initial period of inactivity, many governments have now moved to impose international travel restrictions to prevent any further importation of COVID-19 cases. However, given that the virus is now a global pandemic and has reached most countries it is reasonable to question the impact of ongoing travel restrictions. In this short communication we have used international flight data and models of disease transmission to predict the national epidemic trajectory had travel bans not been put in place. Our results show that the travel ban on individuals arriving from China successfully delayed the onset of widespread transmission in Australia by four weeks. We also showed that travel bans from Hubei Province alone would have been much less effective, as the virus had already spread to many other provinces by the time the bans were enforced. Similarly, until now travel bans for South Korea and Iran (imposed on February 9 and March 5 respectively) were also shown to have negligible impact. However, as the number of cases in these countries continues to rise we expect these restrictions to become increasingly effective. Universal international travel bans coming into force now appear to be the only rational response, however, we need to consider how long they can and should last."
34534,Spatio-temporal propagation of COVID-19 pandemics,"In the absence of both medicine and vaccination, strategies of effective distributing of them are not considered yet [5] and the options to stop the propagation of the disease are currently to quarantines the infected individuals [6] and social distancing [7] in order to cut the infection channels. Statistical estimations of the incubating (latency) period of the virus which includes no signs of illness vary between different populations and found to be of about 4-6 days [8] while a long incubation period of 19 days has also been observed [9] . The 14 days quarantine period, which has been adopted by many countries, is a result of the higher limit of the 95% confidence levels [10] of this incubating period. Under this quarantine strategy, the virus spreading could be alleviated."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"From December 31, 2019 to March 18, 2020, the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) coronavirus pandemic has infected a reported 209,839 number of people, resulting in 8,778 deaths, in 168 countries around the world, and continue to spread exponentially 1 . While the world awaits the development of vaccines and anti-viral medications, traditional public health measures such as isolation of confirmed or suspected cases, quarantine of contacts, and social distancing of the public are effective measures to reduce viral transmission 2, 3 , that have been implemented in many regions and countries 4, 5 ."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Conceptually, an epidemic is dependent on network connectivity and time 7 . As edges of contact are removed, the average degree of each vertex declines, and connectivity falls. Practically, viral transmission is attenuated by isolation, quarantine and social distancing 8, 9, 10 . These public health measures decrease the number of close contacts, resulting in higher degrees of separation within the public, thereby impeding transmission. This paper examines the level of public health measures needed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"In a dynamic network, where edges are added and removed, these parameters vary with time corresponding to changes in social behavior. For example, case isolation decreases the degree of Vi, while quarantine decreases the degree of vertices connected to Vi. Universal precautions such as wearing masks reduces the probability of transmission, wij."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The average generation interval of COVID-19 is about 5 days 11, 12, 13 . (Note that estimates of reproductive numbers are proportional to the assumed generation time.) On average, it take patients 2 days after the start of the infectious period, which can precede symptoms, to seek medical care or report illness 14 . Among sick contacts, 80% are traced by public health and quarantined at home. When individuals practice social distancing such as staying at home, contacts will spend more time with each other by a factor of 1.5. For example, a person who usually spends 12 hours a day with family now spends 18 hours with them. For cases isolated at home, routine precautions reduce household transmission by 50%."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Using COVID-19 epidemic data from China, the initial epicenter of the outbreak, we will derive parameters for the social network model. First, based on a population study of social mixing patterns in China 15 , the mean number of contacts with unique individuals, over the generation time of COVID-19, is 36, population degree of separation 5.88. Then strict social distancing limits contacts to the household setting and shopping for essential supplies, i.e., 6.3 unique individuals (3.3 in household and 3 in nonhousehold settings), degree of separation 11.5. (See supplementary materials.) Confirmed COVID-19 patients were hospitalized or admitted to isolation centers. Then using open-access daily case reports 16 , we calculate the daily mean reproductive number of the COVID-19 epidemic (Figure 1 )."

Therefore, the average probability of infection between two contacts is 10.7%, 35.1% for contacts in the household setting versus 8.26% in non-household settings. (See supplementary materials for calculations.) After public health measures are implemented under baseline assumptions, the daily mean reproductive number decreases from 3.86 to 1.99 by social distancing, to 0.79 by isolating all cases at medical facilities, and to 0.41 by quarantine of case contacts, corresponding to the trajectory in Figure 1 . During the social distancing period, 81% of new cases are predicted to be through household transmission."

Initial social distancing is estimated to reduce contacts from 28.5 to 11.5, that is, an average of 3.6 contacts in the household setting and 7.9 in the non-household setting, degree of separation 7.35. Furthermore, the entire population is quarantined at home, with moderate to severe cases (20%) hospitalized. Therefore, assuming full compliance with social distancing, the reproductive number is predicted to be 1.03. (See supplementary materials for calculations.) After shutting down all non-essential businesses on March 21, the average number of unique contacts per individual over each viral generation period is expected to be 6.6, leading to a predicted reproductive number of 0.97, to be seen in the coming week."

Of confirmed cases, patients with moderate to severe illness (20%) are hospitalized, while patients with mild illness (80%) are isolated at home. Then to contain the epidemic, in addition to public health measures such as contact tracing and quarantine, the average number of unique close contacts per person should be less than 7 over the 5 day generation interval of COVID-19, (3 household contacts and 4 non-household contacts). (See supplementary materials for calculations.) This increases the degrees of separation to 10."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Lastly, we calculate the threshold above which prolonged social distancing measures are needed. Without social distancing, if a single individual is infected with COVID-19, the average probability that any given person will be infected is (R0/k̅ ) d = (2.39/19.3) 6.63 = 0.967 × 10 -6 , or 1 in 1.03 million. Thus, if 1.03 million people become infected in the U.S., then it is likely that the epidemic will reach every person through networks of social contact, unless social distancing is kept in place until vaccines and anti-viral medications become available."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The social network model provides a conceptual framework to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of individuals, that can be used to predict the influence of collective social behavior on overall pandemic trajectories. It shows the importance of social distancing, and the message that to contain the epidemic, every member of the public plays a crucial part in breaking the chain of transmission."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Given the current understanding of COVID-19 viral epidemiology, the epidemic in the U.S. can be controlled by limiting the average number of contacts per person to 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. For an average American family, the 7 contacts might be a spouse, two children, a friend, a neighbor, a colleague, and a cashier during grocery shopping. The time from the beginning of collective social action to the inflection point of the epidemic is about 3 viral generation intervals, totaling 2-3 weeks. Once daily new cases are decreasing, social distancing measures can be gradually relaxed, in phases, to prevent rebound of viral transmission."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"After social distancing becomes widely implemented and most people stay at home, the majority of new cases is expected to be from household transmission. One way to further reduce the epidemic is to bring all patients with confirmed COVID-19 to medical facilities to prevent the spread of infection at home, as was the practice in China, where moderate to severe cases were hospitalized while mild cases were kept in isolation centers until they were no longer infectious on viral nucleic acid testing. This is also the standard of care for other communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, where clinically stable patients are discharged home after three negative induced sputum samples."
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"The so called ""social distancing"" strategy aims to reduce social interactions within the population decreasing the probability of transmission of the infection, represented by the parameter k in the model. A strong reduction of social interactions may thus lead to R 0 < 1 when the infection dies out monotonously, or otherwise, when the reduced R 0 is still larger than unity, it leads to a reduction of the total infected fraction of the population I total = 1 − S(∞), and a lower peak infected fraction. A side effect of this reduction, however, is that the duration of the epidemic outbreak increases significantly. The dependence of the peak infected fraction and the time to maximum infected are shown in Fig. 1 (c). The total infected fraction at the end of the epidemic as a function of R 0 is shown in Fig. 1(d) . For example, starting with a reference value R 0 = 2.4 with time to peak infection around 65 days, reducing R 0 by factor 2 to R 0 = 1.2, extends the time to peak infection to ∼ 320 days, while reducing the maximum infected fraction from ∼ 22% to ∼ 1.5% and the total infected by the end of the epidemic decreases from ∼ 90% to ∼ 30%. Why reducing R 0 by social distancing reduces total infections and the peak infected fraction, which is critical due to the limited hospital infrastructure, (or termination of the epidemic if R 0 < 1) it has the following possible problems:"
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,• since the Covid-19 infection results in mild or no symptoms in a large majority of the population and often remains undetected it is difficult to prevent further transmission (this may be one of the reasons why drastic social distancing introduced in Western Europe had limited success so far)
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,• if R 0 remains > 1 the social distancing can significantly extend the duration of the epidemic making it difficult to maintain the reduced transmissions over a long time period in a large population
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"• perhaps the most important problem is that there is no clear exit strategy until large scale vaccination becomes available. Since at the end of the epidemic a large proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, after relaxation of social distancing, the population is highly susceptible to recurrent epidemic outbreaks due to remaining undetected or imported infections from other regions/countries where the infection has not been eliminated yet"
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,• social distancing measures over extended period of time applied uniformly to a large population leads to widespread disruption of the functioning of the society and economy therefore it has a huge long term cost
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"According to (3) reducing the loss in S V requires reducing the product µI total . While social distancing aims to reduce the total infected by decreasing R 0 (see continuous curve showing I total vs R 0 in Fig. 1D ), this model highlights the possibility of an alternative or complementary measure based on reducing the parameter µ by isolating/shielding the vulnerable population from infections in the majority population. This could be achieved by targeted measures providing free homedelivery of food, medication etc. combined with targeted support addressing communication and healthcare needs, support with creating separated living space where needed. Since the isolation strategy targets a small portion of the population which is less socially active and has a low participation in the economy, a radical isolation is likely to be much more efficient than uniform social distancing, with smaller cost for the economy and the functioning of the society."
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"It is also apparent that the integral in (3) can be reduced by decreasing µ in a time-dependent manner. This can be linked to monitoring the progression of the infection I(t) by statistically representative testing of different regions and cities, and intensifying/relaxing the isolation of the vulnerable population accordingly. According to our model the social distancing (represented by the horizontal arrow in Fig. 1(d) ) and targeted isolation (vertical arrow in Fig. 1(d) ) could be used together in combination to reduce the overall death and hospitalisation rate. However, social distancing extends the duration of the epidemic (which may affect the sustainability of efficient isolation) and results in insufficient overall immunity of the majority population against a recurrence of the epidemic outbreak triggered by hidden or newly imported infection. On the other hand when the strategy is primarily based on drastic targeted isolation over a shorter time, the end result is a collectively immune population resistant to further infections. Therefore, when targeted isolation is implemented with high efficiency, it is preferable to avoid or apply moderate social distancing only to allow a large proportion of the majority population to become infected and develop immunity, at the cost of mostly minor symptoms similarly to a conventional flu season."
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"Our model and conclusions relies on the separation of the population based on age and health into two compartments with very different outcomes. Of course there could be a certain grey area where the separation between the two subpopulations is not always clear. In this case the separation should be determined as a usual trade-off between resources available and risk. The immunity may not be complete but from the limited information currently available on Covid-19, it appears to be fairly robust. In the absence of alternative options available the development of population level immunity could be the optimal resolution of the global pandemic at least in regions where the infection is already widespread, e.g. in Western Europe. Some countries, for example Italy and Spain, implemented severe social distancing, but so far seems to be unable to stop the progress of the epidemic and may in fact be on track towards achieving large scale immunity in the population. However, with too much focus on the implementation of uniform social distancing and no clear targeted measures for identifying and efficiently protecting the vulnerable sub-population can lead to a very dangerous scenario with high mortality in spite of the high social and economic costs of an extended and potentially recurrent epidemic.

34566,Modeling the Corona Virus Outbreak in IRAN,"Conclusions: The Modeling of Covid-19 outbreak shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing. Contagious diseases follow an exponential model and the same be Haves this one. This is because the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person. Disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing. In addition, many factors are effective in stopping the disease. These include citizens' participation in the prevention process, health education, the effectiveness of instructive traditions, environmental conditions, and so on."

34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"Specifically, this paper studies five research questions. First, how does the lockdown of the city of Wuhan amid the Novel Coronavirus outbreak affect population movement? Second, how do population flows among Chinese cities, particularly outflows from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, affect virus infection in the destination cities? Third, is there evidence of, and if so, what is the magnitude of, undocumented cases of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province during the early stages of the epidemic? And how does the extent of undocumented infection cases evolve over time? Fourth, how many COVID-19 cases elsewhere in China were prevented by the unprecedented Wuhan lockdown? Fifth, are social distancing policies in destination cities effective in reducing the spread of the infections? We utilize reliable datasets on population migration among pairs of Chinese cities and the within-city population movements of each city at the daily level from Baidu Migration, and the city-level daily numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases, recovered patients, and death tolls from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) during a sample period of January 1-February 29, 2020, covering 22 days before and 38 days after the city lockdown on January 23, 2020, as well as the matched data from the same lunar calendar period in 2019."
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"We first employ various difference-in-differences (DID) estimation strategies to disentangle the effect of Wuhan lockdown on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect-the Spring festival of the Chinese New Year is on January 25, 2020 (Table 2) . We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases ( Figure 4 ). We discover that the estimated effects of the different lags of inflows from Wuhan and Hubei both show a clear inverted U -shape with respect to the lags, with the largest impact on the newly confirm cases today comes from the inflow population from Wuhan or other cities in Hubei about 12 to 14 days earlier. We find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities. We find that the COVID-19 cases would be 64.81% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province, and 52.64% higher in 16 non-Wuhan cities inside Hubei, in the counterfactual world in which the city of Wuhan were not locked down from January 23, 2020. We also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, but over time, the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated ""actual"" cases narrows significantly. We also find evidence that imposing enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei province is effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities elsewhere."
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"By providing a rigorous estimation of the impact of within and cross-city migration on the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus in China, our study contributes to fast-growing literature on 2019-nCoV infection, mostly in the medical and public health fields. Huang et al. (2020) describe high rates of respiratory distress, intensive care admission, and abnormal findings on chest computed tomography (CT) in the first 41 patients hospitalized from December 16 to January 2 in Wuhan, as well as a 15% death rate. Chan et al. (2020) investigate a family cluster and confirm the human-to-human transmission of this Novel Coronavirus within hospitals and families. The basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in 12 studies has a mean of 3.28 and a median of 2.79 (Liu et al., 2020 ) (compared to 3 for SARS (WTO, 2003) ). This study is also related to disaster-induced migration, which has often occurred during flooding (Gray and Mueller, 2012) , drought (Munshi, 2003) , earthquake (Lu et al., 2012) , and other destructive climatic phenomena. Given that the 2019-nCoV has rapidly spread worldwide due to human travel and caused severe illness and significant mortality, it is therefore essential to understand the impact of various control measures on human mobility and the virus transmission. Qiu et al. (2020) apply machine learning tools and use exogenous temperature, wind speed, and precipitation in the preceding third and fourth weeks as the instruments to show that the massive lockdown and other control measures significantly reduced the virus transmission. Their results highlight that the population outflow from the outbreak source city poses higher risks to the destination cities than other social and economic factors, such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. Our results are also in line with the results of the latest modeling exercises, which mostly rely on model calibrations of various parameters, such as generation time, incubation period, detection rates, and changes in travel flow. Using the Global Epidemic and Mobility model, Chinazzi et al. (2020) project the impact of travel limitation on the national and international spread of the 2019-nCoV. The study finds that only 24.4% of infected cases were reported as of February 1, and the Wuhan lockdown reduced the cases by 10% in cities outside Wuhan by January 31. The study most closely related to ours is Li et al. (2020) , which shows that contagious but undocumented COVID-19 cases facilitated the geographic spread of the epidemic in China. Using a networked dynamic meta-population model and Bayesian inference, Li et al. (2020) find that 86% of all infections were undocumented before the Wuhan lockdown and reported infections would have been reduce by 78.7% in China, without transmission from undocumented cases between January 10 and January 23. Lai et al. (2020) build a travel network-based susceptibleexposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. They use epidemiological parameters estimated from the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterize the transmission before the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) were implemented. The NPIs they consider include travel bans and restrictions, contact reductions and social distancing, early case identification and isolation. Through their sim-ulations, they find that the NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Relative to our study, it is important to point out that in their simulations, they assumed that the pattern of population movements was the same in years when there were no outbreaks and interventions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to provide a causal interpretation of the impact of city lockdown on human mobility and the spread of 2019-nCoV, and to clearly disentangle the lockdown effects from other potential contributing factors such as panic and virus effect, as well as the seasonal Spring Festival effect (see Section 3)."
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data sets used in our analysis. In Section 3, we present different difference-in-difference estimation strategies to separate the lockdown effect, panic effect, virus (deterrence) effect, and the Spring Festival effect on population movements in China. In Section 4, we estimate the distributed lag effects of inflows from the epicenter cities of the 2019-nCoV outbreak on destination cities' daily infection cases. In Section 5, we study how the enhanced social distancing policies, or ""lockdown"" policies, in the destination cities' impact the effects of the population inflows from the epicenter cities. In Section 6, we conclude."
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"Our model also allows us to project when the new infection cases would have peaked in other cities in the absence of Wuhan lockdown. As shown by the solid curves in the left figures of each panel, our model projects that in the absence of Wuhan lockdown, the new daily infection cases in the 16 non-Wuhan cities in Hubei would have peaked on February 2, the 9th day after the lockdown of Wuhan, at a level of 1,466 daily new cases; and elsewhere in China, it would have peaked on February 3, 2020, the 10th day after the lockdown of Wuhan, at a level of 1,082 daily new cases. We also find that the estimated daily new cases in the counterfactual world gradually converge to the reported daily cases from February 22, suggesting that the social distancing measures implemented elsewhere in China would have worked eventually to contain the spread of 2019-nCoV virus, even if the city of Wuhan was not locked down on January 23 2020, but the initial onslaught on the medical system in all cities in China would have been much more severe, and the total number of infection cases elsewhere would have been significantly higher."
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"As the 2019-nCoV virus spread throughout the world, many countries are also implementing lockdown measures, and mandate social distancing as a policy response to contain the spread of the virus. Up to now, our analysis has focused on the events of the lockdown of Wuhan -the epicenter of the Novel Coronavirus outbreak, it would also be interesting to study the impact of lockdowns and/or the social distancing measures in the destination cities in reducing and containing the spread of virus. Indeed, Chinazzi et al. (2020) point out that travel restrictions to and from Mainland China impact the global pandemic of the COVID-19 only if transmission within the community is simultaneously reduced by 50% or more, which suggests that social distancing at the destination cities is crucial in preventing the possibly asymptomatic transmission from the source city. Moreover, quantifying the effect of social distancing on virus transmission is especially relevant to the stage of pre-epidemic community spread when a person who is not known to have traveled to affected countries, or to have had contact with an infected person becomes infected."

We interpret the human mobility restrictions in the destination cities as an enhanced social distancing policy, because the ""lockdown"" rules in the destination cities are not as strict as those implemented in Wuhan. In this section, we use the variations in the destination cities' ""lockdown"" policies to study how the effects of inflows from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province on the spread of COVID-19 cases in the destination cities are impacted by the changes in the destination cities' lockdown policies, which would drastically impact the within-city population movements in the destination cities. 20 Specifically, we estimate the following specification that is a modified version of the regression specification described by Equation (3):"
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"where the new variable Lockdown i,t is a dummy that takes value 1 if time t is a date after destination city i's ""lockdown"" date, if at all; and 0 otherwise, where the lockdown dates of the 63 cities outside Hubei are listed in Table A1 . If city i never implemented any formal lockdown policy, the dummy is always 0. Therefore, the coefficients, β 1κ and β 2κ , respectively, measure the impact of the lagged inflows from Wuhan and Hubei κ days earlier on the destination cities' current new cases before the city's imposition of its ""lockdown,"" while γ 1κ and γ 2κ represent the effect on destination cities' of Wuhan and Hubei inflows after the imposition of the city's lockdown. If enhanced social distancing that comes from the ""lockdown policies"" imposed at the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei is effective in reducing the spread of the virus from population flows from the epicenter of the virus, then we expect that γ 1κ and γ 2κ to be smaller than β 1κ and β 2κ , respectively. 20 See Panel C of Table 2 for the evidence from Wuhan lockdown on within-Wuhan population movement."
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"These results suggest that the enhanced social distancing policies in the destination cities are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the source cities of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities. This in turn implies that population inflows from the epicenter contribute to the spread of infection in the destination cities only before the social distancing measures are applied; it appears that after implementing their various control measures, cities adopting an extended lockdown can flatten the upward trajectory of the virus."
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"In this paper, we quantify the causal impact of human mobility restrictions, particularly the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, on the containment and delay of the spread of the Novel Coronavirus, and estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%.

Enhanced social distancing in the destination cities, and, if an epicenter can be identified as was the case for the city of Wuhan in China, a lockdown, can play crucial roles in ""flattening"" the daily infection cases curve, giving the stressed medical system a chance to regroup and deal with the onslaught of new infection cases. Although our study focuses exclusively on the effect of human mobility restrictions on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in China, our estimated results can have general implications to other countries in their fight against the Novel Coronavirus."
34582,Home collection of nasal swabs for detection of influenza in the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation Study,"Previous studies have demonstrated that nasal swabs collected by research participants under the supervision of research or clinical staff are feasible for the identification of respiratory virus infections [6] [7] [8] [9] 12, 16, 17] . In many of these studies acceptability of self-or parent-collection was preferred to investigator or clinician collection [7, 16] . In the few studies of unsupervised collection, self-collected specimens were collected and returned in the timeframe recommended by the research team [6, 16] . In addition, specimen quality in many studies has been similar regardless of collection method [5, 19] . A Canadian study found that both viral loads and RNaseP were similar between self-collected and investigator-collected specimens [8] . A study in pregnant women found 100% of self-collected specimens detected RNaseP [6] , as we found in the current study. Other measures of specimen quality have also been similar between collection methods [11, 18] . Importantly, many of these feasibility studies were pilot studies with relatively small sample sizes, and self-collection was often completed in the presence of the study investigators. Our study confirms the feasibility and timeliness of unsupervised collection of respiratory specimens in a large, longitudinal cohort study. As we are currently experiencing with COVID-19 pandemic, unsupervised collection Is essential to provide maximum protection to research staff and participants and to comply with social distancing guidelines from public health authorities."
34587,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","This pathogen represents a significant challenge for public health, pandemic planning, and healthcare systems. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible (4) (5) (6) (7) . It causes moderate to severe clinical outcomes in approximately 20% of all recognized infected individuals (5, 8, 9) . In the absence of a vaccine, public health responses have focused on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (10) . These NPIs include: (1) ""case-based"" measures such as testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, and (2) ""non-case-based"" measures such as reducing the probability of transmission given an effective contact (e.g. hand hygiene, and cough etiquette), and social distancing measures to reduce the contact rate in the population. Social distancing minimizes opportunities for person-to-person transmission of the virus to occur. These social distancing measures include some combination of school closure, teleworking, cancellation of group activities and events, and a general overall reduction in community contacts. While they are expected to be effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they are also associated with substantial economic costs and social disruption."
34587,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","Testing was assumed to move individuals with non-severe symptoms from the infectious to isolated compartments. Isolated cases were assumed to have reduced transmission compared to non-isolated cases. Social distancing measures were assumed to reduce the number of contacts per day across the entire population. Details of parameters that were varied under different interventions are included in Table 2 . For the base case, we assumed that there was a degree of testing and isolation occurring and that a proportion of exposed cases were quarantined. We then added in additional control measures: (i) enhanced testing and contact tracing; (ii) restrictive social distancing measures; and (iii) a combination of enhanced testing and contract tracing, along with less restrictive social distancing than in (ii). We considered two approaches to implementing interventions: (i) fixed durations and (ii) a dynamic approach with interventions turned on and off based on the number of cases requiring ICU care in the population. We focused on ICU capacity, since this is expected to be most limited resource during the COVID-19 epidemic.

The effectiveness of the interventions scaled with intervention duration. For all interventions, when the intervention duration was 6 months or less, there was no appreciable difference on final attack rate. With 12 and 18 months of heightened response measures, the proportion of the population infected at the end of the 2year period was reduced and, in some simulations, the prevalence of cases requiring intensive care fell below Ontario's current capacity for all or part of the time period.

There was substantial variability in model projections, due to model stochasticity."
34587,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","We also explored dynamic interventions that were turned on and off in response to the current state of the epidemic. Dynamic interventions were projected to be effective for reducing the proportion of the population infected at the end of the two-year period, with potentially shorter durations of social distancing than the fixed duration approach (Figure 4) . For example, when implemented dynamically, 13 months of social distancing, cycled on and off, reduced the mean overall attack rate to 2%. For the social distancing alone and combination intervention scenarios, we observed atypical epidemic curves, with the number of cases increasing and decreasing repeatedly over time. In these scenarios, the median number of cases in ICU was reduced below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity."

In broad terms, we find that prolonged social distancing is the preferred strategy for maintaining ICU resources, but an extreme fixed duration of social distancing is required to prevent the epidemic from overwhelming ICU capacity. That said, social distancing, even without reducing overall outbreak size, has the added benefit of delaying the epidemic peak, which gains time that can be used to build health system capacity and identify therapies and vaccines."
34587,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","In contrast to fixed-duration social distancing, we find that dynamic social distancing, with interventions turned on and off as needed, based on ICU capacity crossing a given threshold, represents a more effective, and likely more palatable, control strategy. Social distancing can be relaxed, but this inevitably results in resurgent disease in the population, requiring reinstatement. Nonetheless, dynamic social distancing is projected to maintain ICU capacity, and dramatically reduces overall attack rates, while at the same time requiring less total social distancing time than would be required by a fixed duration strategy of comparable effectiveness. Furthermore, dynamic social distancing has the potential to allow populations, and the economy, to ""come up for air"" at intervals, which may make this strategy more sustainable. We also found that a combination approach, with less restrictive social distancing along with enhanced case isolation and quarantine, could have a similar effect in the dynamic scenario as more restrictive social distancing alone. It is plausible that, as testing capacity increases, a combination approach that is less reliant on social distancing, will strike the right balance between disease control and societal disruption (30)."

Any model involves trade-offs between simplicity and realism, and in the current work we have not attempted to model social distancing measures in a highly realistic way, but rather generically as reductions in contact frequency. Our understanding of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to evolve and the precise role of pre-symptomatic and subclinical transmission is uncertain. Social distancing becomes a more important control measure in the face of incomplete case ascertainment due to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. The model does not include seasonality; it is possible that transmission will attenuate in the summer (31), resulting in a decline in cases that would be expected to resurge with the return of colder weather. All of these factors mean that the quantitative findings are subject to uncertainty."
34587,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","Nonetheless, the qualitative insights around the role of social distancing, the relatively long intervention durations required to bend the epidemic curve, and the potential use of cyclic interventions can be used to policy-makers and decision makers, along with emerging empirical evidence from other countries, to consider the best approaches for epidemic control over the coming months. Lastly, we have not modeled the fact that that abrupt surges in death resulting from full ICUs would, result in lower demands for ICU beds. Our goal here is to inform policy so that such outcomes are avoided to the extent possible."

In the absence of significant social distancing or a combination of moderate social distancing with enhanced case detection and isolation, we project that ICU resources would be quickly overwhelmed, a conclusion consistent with that in other modeling work (12) , as well as current events in Italy and Spain.

Exposed cases can be either quarantined or not; quarantined cases would represent those who were identified via contact tracing. Hospitalized cases are assumed to be no longer infectious to others due to recognition of infection and are included in the model to estimate healthcare requirements. The model is stratified by age group and presence/absence of comorbidities.
34609,An international comparison of the second derivative of COVID-19 deaths after implementation of social distancing measures,"Data was obtained from European Centre for Disease Control website [2] on 24/03/2020. All reported deaths from confirmed cases of COVID19 were extracted into a time series of daily deaths for eight countries: China, Italy, Spain, France, USA, UK, Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea. In order to ensure that all included countries had sufficient counts to derive the necessary statistics, countries with fewer than 120 cumulative deaths were excluded. Daily fatality rates from the included countries were then used to calculate estimates of the relative second derivative of total deaths, N, 1/N d 2 N/dt 2 , for a period of at least ten days. All these countries have initiated social distancing measures at different points in time. Iran has been excluded as the very low variance in the data is not compatible with the statistics seen in the other seven countries analysed. The cumulative deaths for each country, N(t), were estimated by deriving a multiplier N final /N(t conv ) at the time of convergence, t conv , to the Chinese trajectory, N final being the total number of deaths in China and applying this multiplier to Chinese data for times beyond convergence. The daily deaths were derived by taking the differences in cumulative deaths. Fig. 1 shows the relative second derivative plotted as a times series for each country compared to China, calculated after total deaths reached at least 20. An exponential rate corresponds to a constant value over time, but for China the daily rate has been falling from an initial 50% to very close to zero, with the fall occurring over a 30-day period after lockdown was announced for Wuhan on 23/01/2020. In fig. 1 , the time series of the other countries have been aligned to best match the trajectory seen in China, with the announcement of lockdowns and implementation of social distancing measures in each country marked. Comparing to China, the daily growth rate in total deaths in Italy has been closely following the trajectory for the last 15 days subsequent to the announcement of lockdown in Lombardy on 8/3/2020. Spain has also seen some convergence on China's trajectory for the last seven days following a national lockdown implemented on 12/3/2020, but with a higher variance. In the case of France, lock-down measures came into force on 16/3/2020, and the trajectory has converged, again with a higher variance, for the last six days. The USA also shows some convergence for the last four days, with lockdowns implemented only to the state level at the time of writing. The UK has converged on China's trajectory for the last seven days, with a higher initial variance which in part is due to the sampling statistics from a relatively low fatality count to date; although no lockdown has been announced, general social distancing was advised by the government on 16/3/2020. Germany implemented social distancing in phases from Mar 8 until Mar 16 when stringent measures were announced nationally while the Netherlands did the same later and more slowly from 12/03 through 23/03/2020, ending in ""targeted"" lockdowns."
34609,An international comparison of the second derivative of COVID-19 deaths after implementation of social distancing measures,"The observed convergences to date, at an early point in the Chinese trajectory, for Italy, Spain, France, USA, UK, Netherlands and Germany, would indicate convergence of the combined transmission and fatality rate for these eight countries. If a similar fatality rate is assumed, this would imply these countries are converging on the same trajectory in transmission rates, the stated goal of efforts at social distancing."
34609,An international comparison of the second derivative of COVID-19 deaths after implementation of social distancing measures,"Although the strength of social distancing has varied in all eight countries, with China's the most restrictive and closely monitored, overall these measures appear to be sufficient at this time to produce a similar fall in cumulative death rates. This implies there may be a threshold of intervention sufficient to achieve the desired trajectory. South Korea's policies, with intervention at an early stage, has been successful in reducing the rate of increase in deaths to that seen in the latter stages of lockdown in Wuhan. If the present trend continues, the Netherlands' policy of ""targeted"" lockdowns may also be achieving a similar result."
34609,An international comparison of the second derivative of COVID-19 deaths after implementation of social distancing measures,"In general, this analysis suggests that early adoption of social distancing is more effective than delayed implementation, even of highly restrictive measures. If China's policies aimed at achieving suppression represent a maximum possible reduction in transmission from initially high rates, then estimates based on their curve will undercount both the total deaths and maximum death rates for other countries and hence represent a reasonable lower bound for modelling: the lowest estimate of total deaths in the models in Ferguson et al."

34673,A deductive approach to modeling the spread of COVID-19,"The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issuing a travel alert to the Wuhan region on January 6, 2020 8 . Various countries systematically blocked international travel from known COVID-19 hot-spots, including China, Iran, and the European Union. At the time of writing, nearly 80 nations have a global travel ban with an additional 9 implementing global quarantine measures 9 . These efforts hope to prevent local seeding of infection, each of which can rapidly increase case numbers. When examining smaller confined communities exposed to SARS-COV-2, the disease spreads unabated. Initial studies examined high-density exposed cohorts, including cruise ships, prisons, nursing homes, and healthcare workers [10] [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, it appears that containment of COVID-19 primarily be mitigated by preventing local seeding through travel restriction and reducing the population density around potential infected person."
34673,A deductive approach to modeling the spread of COVID-19,"Looking forward, we advise countries to rapidly implement policies to augment the spread of COVID-19. The exponential spread of disease is difficult to intuitively explain to the general population. In everyday life, we encounter arithmetic changes more often than exponential changes. Our instinct of examining relatively manageable changes to the case load to make policy decisions will quickly be eclipsed by the exponential expansion of this disease. Further complicating the matter is an estimation that 17.9% of COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic 23 . Looking at the data from the Diamond Princess cruise line, most of the cases occurred before or around the start of the quarantine. This reemphasizes the importance to make proactive, as opposed to reactive, policy decisions. It additionally demonstrates the importance of individual responsibility towards social distancing and personal hygiene. Should countries integrate the methods behind the success noted in South Korea, Japan, and Iran, thousands, perhaps millions, of deaths be prevented."
34674,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"We simulated two types of control strategy: suppression and mitigation. Both types of strategy were modelled by reduction in the transmission coefficient, resulting in a proportional reduction in the reproduction number with control (Rc). This is a very simple control model which assumes that transmission rates from pre-symptomatic, unconfirmed symptomatic and confirmed symptomatic infections are all reduced by a constant factor. This describes society-wide control interventions, such as social distancing, hygiene measures, and lockdowns. It does not account for control measures that specifically target confirmed cases, such as case isolation. These could be modelled by a larger reduction in transmission rates for confirmed cases; we did not attempt this but it could be included in future model refinements to investigate the dependence of control efficacy on testing. The magnitude of the reduction in Rc was calibrated by comparisons with international data on case trajectories ( Fig. 2 ) and modelling studies for the UK and US outbreaks (Ferguson et al 2020) . The latter study assumed that interventions would have a similar impacts as they do with seasonal influenza. We then simulated suppression strategies by a fixed reduction in Rc for a period of 400 days. We simulated mitigation strategies by dynamic changes in Rc aimed at keeping the demand on the healthcare system under capacity (i.e. current infections under 40,000). In all cases, control began at t = 42 days after exposure of the initial seed infections. Table 1 . Estimates for the hospitalisation rate, ICU admission rate and case fatality rate (CFR) for New Zealand. These were calculated from the age-specific rates published by CDC (2020) combined with the age structure of New Zealand's population (StatsNZ). These values assume that NZ has a similar healthcare system, rates of underlying health conditions, and Covid-19 testing rates as the US. Note that our model uses lower values than these estimates, which is reasonable because the model parameters represent rates per infection, which will be lower than rates per confirmed case if some infections are asymptomatic, subclinical or otherwise undiagnosed. "
34674,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"We simulated an uncontrolled epidemic (Rc=2.5) and five levels of increasingly strong control that reduce Rc to 2.3, 2, 1.75, 1.3, 1.2 (Fig. 3) . These correspond approximately to the control measures modelled by Ferguson et al (2020) of: (i) closing schools and universities (Rc=2.3); (ii) case isolation (Rc=2); (iii) case isolation and household quarantine (Rc=1.75); (iv) case isolation, household quarantine, and population-wide social distancing (Rc=1.3); and (v) case isolation, household quarantine, population-wide social distancing, and closing schools and universities (Rc=1.2). However, note that there is considerable uncertainty and country-dependent variation in the effectiveness of any given control intervention, and these values of Rc should be seen as a range of potential outcomes, rather than a prediction of a given control measure."
34674,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044677 doi: medRxiv preprint Mitigation. Mitigation strategies were simulated as a combination of a low level of control (case isolation and household quarantine, reducing Rc to 1.75) with periods of high control as required to try and keep the number of cases under hospital capacity. There are various ways this could be achieved. One approach is a ""switching"" strategy ( Fig. 4) in which strong controls are imposed when hospital capacity is close to full (shaded blue areas in Fig. 4) and relaxed when there is spare hospital capacity available. The scenario shown in Fig. 4 requires the strong control periods to reduce Rc below 1 (Rc = 0.75 during periods in strong control in Fig. 4 ). Strong control is initiated when the number of ICU cases reaches capacity, and is lifted when the number of ICU cases drops to 50% of capacity. This is comparable to the scenario tested by Ferguson et al (2020) , where weak control means Rc=1.75 (representing case isolation and household quarantine in the Ferguson et al (2020) model) and strong control means Rc=0.75 (representing the above measures plus populationwide social distancing in Ferguson et al (2020)). Periods of alternating strong/weak control are required to continue for approximately 750 days to prevent hospital capacity from being exceeded."
34674,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"Mitigation strategies allow the disease to spread then apply control to reduce the peak allowing hospitals to be less overwhelmed. In general mitigation requires an initial period of weak control to allow the epidemic to establish, then an extended period (3-4 months) of very strong control. This can be followed by periods when control measures can be loosened, but strong control needs to be re-established when cases increase towards hospital capacity. One way to approach this is alternating periods of strong control (shaded blue, Rc=0.75) and weak control (unshaded, Rc =1.75) as shown in the graphs. Fig. 4 to succeed requires control measures sufficiently strong to force Rc below 1. It remains completely unknown whether a scenario such as that shown in Fig. 4 is achievable in practice in New Zealand or any comparable country. Fig. 2 shows that the only countries that have so far succeeded in getting the effective reproduction number less than 1 are China and South Korea. In those countries, this has been achieved by extremely intensive measures, including mandatory and strictly enforced quarantine, huge amounts of resources devoted to contact tracing, electronic surveillance of citizens' movements, etc. In other countries, including those that have instigating major lockdowns such as Italy, there is as yet insufficient evidence that this has reduced Rc to 1 (Fig. 2) ."
34674,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"Mitigation strategies, which aim to allow the epidemic to go ahead at a controlled rate, keep demand on healthcare systems under capacity, and deliver herd immunity, are a tempting approach for the control of Covid-19. However, model results show that for these to be successful requires the ability to reduce transmission to a level where the effective reproduction number Rc is close to or below 1. It remains unknown whether this will be achievable in practice in New Zealand. There is no evidence that it has yet been achieved in comparable, western democracies, including those that have instigated major lockdowns such as Italy. The only regimes that have conclusively achieved this level of control are China and South Korea. In these countries, this has been achieved by extremely intensive measures, including mandatory and strictly enforced quarantine, huge amounts of resources devoted to contact tracing, electronic surveillance of citizens' movements, etc. In addition, successful mitigation requires periods of these intensive control measures to be continued for up to 2.5 years before the population acquires a sufficient level of herd immunity. This could be an underestimate as these models do not include population turnover via birth-death, which will become significant over this time frame and may act to reduce the build-up of herd immunity. Furthermore, correct timing of strong control measures is crucial to successfully keeping healthcare systems from being overloaded. Small uncertainties in case trajectories could lead to drastically overshooting hospital and ICU capacity. If hospitalisation and/or ICU admission rates are in reality higher than assumed here, e.g. closer to the CDC (2020) estimates (Table 1) , then mitigation strategies aimed at keeping ICU load under become even more difficult. Expanding New Zealand's ICU capacity would alleviate this somewhat, and would be a sensible precaution in any case."
34674,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"If strong suppression is successful in reducing the number of cases close to zero, it is possible that some control measures could be lifted. This would require: (i) continued widespread testing and contact tracing to ensure there are no undetected case clusters; and (ii) strong border measures to remain in place to ensure no fresh infections are imported. This approach is similar in principle to the on-off strategy shown in Fig. 4 , but with the crucial difference that it aims to keep cases close to zero (as opposed to merely under ICU capacity). As long as (i) and (ii) are in place and we are confident that there are no undetected cases, this could allow periods when schools, businesses and services can operate and many aspects of day-to-day life to continue."
34698,A Genomic Survey of SARS-CoV-2 Reveals Multiple Introductions into Northern California without a Predominant Lineage,"Public health containment measures such as prompt isolation and contact tracing, as performed in the Solano County and Santa Clara County clusters, become more difficult to maintain once a lineage becomes established in the community. Our data suggest concerning trends in this direction, such as the association between the WA1 lineage and communityacquired COVID-19 cases in several counties of Northern California, travel-associated introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the San Francisco Bay Area from New York state, and a virus from the lineage associated with a Santa Clara County cluster detected in a resident of Solano County. Social distancing interventions, such as the ""shelter-in-place"" directive that was issued by the governor of California on March 20, 2020, may assist in stemming community spread of imported cases. If interstate dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 lineages within the US is common, then the suspension of non-essential domestic and international long-range travel may be necessary to prevent further importation of new cases in California and other states."
34701,Prediction of the time evolution of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Italy by a Gauss Error Function and Monte Carlo simulations,"Using the first 41 days of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of Covid-19 in Italy (i.e., from February 15, 2020 to March 26, 2020) with a fitting function of the type of the Gauss Error Function with four free parameters (a distribution function which well fits the corresponding cumulative diagnosed positive cases in China), we obtained that the day of the flex (i.e., the day of deceleration in the number of daily positive cases) is in Italy, with a 95.4% probability, between March 23, 2020 and March 27, 2020; the 2-sigma uncertainty of +/-2 days was obtained with a Monte Carlo simulation using the first 40 days. In regard to the day of a substantial reduction in the number of the daily positive cases (which, for example, we took to be less than 100), this day will be in Italy, with a 95.4% probability, between April 17, 2020 and April 27, 2020; the 2-sigma uncertainty of +/-2 days was also obtained with the Monte Carlo simulation using the first 41 days. This predictions are statistical in nature and do not model the relevant factors of social distancing, and epidemiological and virology studies, which are outside the purpose of the present paper."
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"The recent outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan, China has led to a pandemic with significant impacts on public-health and economy across the globe. As the number of infected people increases in a community, public health policies move away from containment of the outbreak to mitigation strategies such as social distancing and isolation, with considerable detrimental effects on public life and the economy. While less restrictive mitigation strategies would be desirable, alternative choices are limited due to a lack of resources and technologies. To better understand the potential effects of a particular mitigation strategy, we must assess the underlying factors that impact the spread of the outbreak, and therefore mathematical models integrating the relevant underlying mechanisms are a good tool."
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"While a few pandemic-spread investigations of Covid-19 have already been published, e.g. using the SEIS approach [13] and in a more recent study of non-pharmaceutical interventions [6] , no studies which investigate the effect of mass testing are found in the literature. To achieve this, it is necessary to separate the category of detected cases from infected cases that remain undetected (e.g. by the sheer lack of test kits) and predict their coupled dynamics. Note that detected here refers to persons taken ""out of the game"", which comprises not only those being tested positive, but also those who feel strong symptoms and thus stay in self-quarantine. It is further important to notice that in the case of this specific virus, infected people can infect others unusually long before the onset of symptoms due to the long active infection phase (the time of infection to infectiousness, i.e., the latency period, is shorter than the time from infection to disease, i.e., the incubation period). Therefore, early detection and containment of infected but symptom-free people can be extremely relevant for the dynamic behavior. Hence, in this paper we devise a set of reaction equations focusing on both detected and undetected categories. Moreover, the impact of the shortage of intensive care units during peaks of the pandemic are integrated in the outcome of the scenarios. The model coefficients are calibrated based on existing data, and the model is employed to investigate two main mitigation approaches, one relying on social distancing and one on more frequent infection testing. Also, a combination of the two is studied."
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"The model was tuned with data of reported Covid-19 cases outside of China 1 from January 22 to March 12, 2020; see table 2. Note that it is important to employ data from a period before measures like social distancing were taken. The considered initial susceptible population size is n s (0) = n s,init = 6 384 631 490 (world population outside of China) and the reported number of deaths at the end of day 50 is 1 440. During the first 50 days (""tuning phase"") n s ≈ n s,init and thus the model simplifies to"
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"It is important to note thatk is the decisive parameter for the dynamics of the system, i.e., the number of undetected infected people starts to decline (and thereby the rate of transmission and the effective reproductive number of the virus), if k d + k r becomes larger than k i (exact, if n s n s,init ). This means that the system can be stabilized by either reducing the infection rate (containment or social distancing) or by more frequent testing. This is consistent with the requirement that the basic reproduction number R 0 of the virus in the susceptible population is smaller than one. This number represents ""the expected number of secondary cases produced, in a completely susceptible population, by a typical infective individual"" [5] . If R 0 becomes < 1, the spread will decline, and if R 0 > 1, the virus spread will increase.

34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"Notice that the reproduction number would be different, if we consider the whole susceptible population without isolating the detected ones. By inspecting Eq. (16), we observe that we can move towards a disease free state corresponding to R 0 ≤ 1 by either reducing k i or increasing k d . The former can be enforced by mitigation policies such as social distancing, while the latter can be attained by mass testing of asymptomatic individuals."
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"In this section we investigate the effect of two different mitigation strategies: social distancing and mass testing.

In the logarithmic plot one can see that the number of infected persons remains constant during the social distancing phase (as expected when R 0 = 1), but the number of cases and deaths keeps increasing. Note that afterwards only a very small fraction of the population is immune. With some delay after social distancing is abandoned, the numbers raise exponentially until more than half of the population becomes immune. Figure 5c shows the case with 70% lower infection rate in the period from 50 to 100 days. This time the virus reproduction factor R 0 is smaller than one and the number of infected persons declines exponentially; seen in the logarithmic plot. After the social distancing phase there is a delay of approximately 200 days before the numbers climb exponentially until more than half of the initial population is immune. In both cases one obtains the same endemic state as in the base case, i.e., temporary social distancing only delays the main outbreak. Therefore, the success of a containment strategy eventually relies on discovering an effective and cheap vaccine in due time.

The detected infected population (dotted lines) is shown together with the intensive care unit capacity (horizontal long dashed lines)."
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"The second mitigation strategy we investigated is mass testing with isolation of detected cases. The same periods as in the cases of Figs. 5a and 5b are considered; once with a 1.7666 times higher detection rate (corresponding to a reproduction factor of one) and once with a 2.8240 times higher detection rate (same reproduction number as with 70% lower infection rate), respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 6 and one can see that they are very similar as those shown in Fig. 5 . This demonstrates that mass testing would have a similar effect as social distancing, and provided effective testing methods become available, this approach has the important advantage that the world's economy would not come to a halt. Like in the case of social distancing, unless one assumes that the virus can be defeated completely and globally, testing would have to be continued until an effective vaccine becomes widely available.

It is found that the latter can significantly reduce the percentage of people getting infected and the death toll. It is important to emphasize here that more testing has to be applied to individuals without symptoms, since those with symptoms contain themselves automatically in most cases. As improved testing capacities are built up, our approach may help to decide when alternative mitigation methods may not only complement, but eventually replace the current social distancing regime. This may help to minimize the socio-economical impacts resulting from severe social isolation policies. While social distancing is currently essential, it is of utmost importance that the testing capabilities are upgraded such that they cover large portions of affected populations in the near future."

Second, we build an individual-level based network model and perform stochastic simulations to reconstruct the epidemics in Hubei Province at its early stage and examine the epidemic dynamics under different scenarios. We consider four scenarios: keeping the early-stage trend without any mitigation, reducing the average node degree within a city through social distancing, reducing the infection rate by adopting protective measures, and decreasing the infection rate through both social distancing and protective measures. Third, we simulate the epidemic spreading in Wuhan City incorporating non-Markovian processes, i.e., non-exponential parameter distributions, and compare the predicted epidemic trajectories obtained from Markov processes."
34714,"Short-term forecasts and long-term mitigation evaluations for the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province, China","The predicted epidemic dynamics from GEMF stochastic simulations are shown in Fig. 5 . We consider four different scenarios: continuing the current trend (Scenario1); decreasing 2 by 25% (Scenario 2); reducing the average node degree inside a city from 15 to 10 (Scenario 3); reducing 2 by 25% and average node degree from 15 to 10 (Scenario 4). Preventive measures such as wearing masks can help reduce the infection rate. On the other hand, the average node degree refers to the possible contacts a person may have in daily life, and this can be reduced by contact reduction and social distancing."
34714,"Short-term forecasts and long-term mitigation evaluations for the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province, China","Overall, GEMF simulation results suggest that more strict prevention and control measures have been taken since February 12 th to achieve the current cumulative confirmed cases in Hubei Province. Preventive measures and social distancing measures need to be taken in combination by the government to speed up the containment of the epidemic and reduce the peak infection dramatically."

Our simulation results indicate that the containment of this highly contagious disease was achieved by stringent control measures by the Chinese government. Without continued and aggressive control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province would have become persistent. If the infection rate is reduced through the enhanced protective measures by 25%, the epidemic would reach the peak in mid-February and fade out in late September. Reducing the average node degree inside each city via social distancing measures, the number of infectious cases would peak at mid-February and decrease to zero at mid-June. Only with combined implementation of enhanced protective measures and social distancing measures, the epidemic dynamics would peak at around mid-February and approximate the actual epidemic trajectory in March. This can be an important message for countries going through the exponential growth of the epidemic in the current days."
34718,Potential roles of social distancing in mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea,"Since its first appearance in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1] , coronavirus disease has spread internationally, including to South Korea. The first COVID-19 case in South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020, from a traveling resident of Wuhan, China [2] . In February, the disease spread rapidly within a church community in the city of Daegu [2] . The chains of transmission that began from this cluster distinguish the epidemic in South Korea from that in any other countries: As of March 24, 2020, 9,037 cases were confirmed, of which 56% were related to the church and 27% were in their 20s [2] . South Korea's intensive testing using novel contact tracing techniques allowed rapid identification and isolation cases and reduction of onward transmission [3, 4, 5] . Here, we describe potential roles of social distancing in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea by using metro traffic data to compare epidemics in two major cities."
34718,Potential roles of social distancing in mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea,"In Seoul, estimates of R t decrease slightly but remain around 1 (Fig. 2D ). Our analysis suggests that social distancing in Seoul was less intense, and this could be why reduction in spread was less sharp. Stronger distancing or further intervention will be necessary to reduce R t below 1."
34718,Potential roles of social distancing in mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea,"The South Korean experience with COVID-19 provides evidence that epidemics can be suppressed with less extreme measures than those taken by China [18] . It demonstrates the necessity of prompt identification and isolation of cases in preventing further spread [3, 4, 5] . Our analysis reveals potential roles of social distancing in mitigating the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. Even though social distancing alone may not be able to fully prevent the spread of the disease, its ability to flatten the epidemic curve (cf. Fig. 2B ,D) reduces burden for healthcare system and provides time to plan for the future [19] ."
34718,Potential roles of social distancing in mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea,"Our analysis focused on comparing metro traffic, which serves as a proxy for the degree of social distancing, with epidemiological dynamics in two cities. The 80% decrease in traffic volume suggests that the strength of social distancing in Daegu may be comparable to that in Wuhan, China [21] . However, we are not able to directly estimate the effect of social distancing on epidemiological dynamics. Other measures, such as intensive testing of core transmission groups and school closure, are also likely to have affected the changes in R t [2] . Future studies should consider quantifying contributions of different measures in preventing the spread."
34719,Modeling of COVID-19 Pandemic and Scenarios for Containment,"The note examines multiple policy scenarios and their effectiveness. Although the model is estimated for Iran, many countries are in similar stages of the pandemic or soon will be in the same stage and therefore, based on the results, extreme measures need to be adopted to save lives and stop further spread of the virus. Social distancing alone cannot stop this disease except if more than 80 percent of the population confine themselves for quite an extended period of time. However, if the number of testing increases massively, and countries' authorities successfully isolate infected individuals, the pandemic can be controlled before the summertime, even with a less degree of confinement."
34719,Modeling of COVID-19 Pandemic and Scenarios for Containment,"While the paper simulates various scenarios of containment, it does not address the economic cost of each scenario. In line with recent findings, the note argues that a fast and aggressive multi-layer intervention is needed to have a substantial dent of the transmission. What the paper calls for is a clear and transparent strategy by governments to implement social distancing and aggressive testing. The testing, should be targeted to geographic locations that the virus is wide spread, to airports and cruise ships, to road travellers, and anyone who has been in areas that are hot spot or has been in any contact with someone in affected locations over the past two weeks. The strategy should not ""just"" focus on those that show symptoms but should include ""all"" who might have been exposed. In this exceptional environment, governments can use temporarily a combination of location data and credit card information to track COVID-19 in their countries and use surveillance tools to monitor quarantined individuals."
34719,Modeling of COVID-19 Pandemic and Scenarios for Containment,"Although Iran initially refused to fully quarantine the holy city of Qom and later the other cities, the government started to react to the epidemic by cancelling all cultural, religious and sportive events, and closing of universities and schools in several cities. The authorities refused to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak and instead asked people to remain inside their houses on a voluntary basis, without any enforcing measures. Some religious sites remained open until mid-March. Unlike every year in late March (Persian New Year) the authorities urged the public to avoid travelling for the two-weeks holidays. However, according the official statistics, roads were still busy, and millions of people travelled, making the self-quarantine policy ineffective. In the absence of firm suppression policies 4 , we simulate the model based on the changes in the behaviors of the public by comparing i) the baseline or uncontrolled scenario, ii) with complete isolation of identified infected cases, iii) case isolation and self-quarantine, iv) intensive testing, identification of cases and quarantine, v) a combination of previous scenarios, vi) abandoning shelter-in-place policy one month after the peak of the epidemic under scenario v. Scenario (ii) is implemented by assuming β Q = 0, meaning that as soon as an individual is reported as infected, all necessary measures are taken to stop contagion from this person to other people. China forced hospitalization of all ""confirmed cases"" and not just those who required hospital care, to reduce onward transmission in the household and potentially in other social settings. Results show that this scenario is not effective and the epidemic progress almost at the same rate with and without complete isolation of identified cases."
34719,Modeling of COVID-19 Pandemic and Scenarios for Containment,"Scenario (iii) is implemented by choosing smaller values for β I of the base scenario, as it depends on the contact rate between individuals, in addition to β Q = 0. Adding social distancing saves many lives (figure 6), but at this stage of the epidemic at least 80 to 90 percent of the population should practice shelter-in-place. Sadly, if only one quarter of the population continue regular contacts with each other, the number of death cases can easily surpass a quarter of a million, and clearly, this policy will not be enough to overrun hospitals' maximum capacity (figure 5)."
34719,Modeling of COVID-19 Pandemic and Scenarios for Containment,"We implement scenario (iv) by assuming that the health authorities will increase number of testing by 10 folds. This helps isolate infected cases, provides patients with necessary medical assistance and decelerates spread of the disease to the rest of population. This policy would shift individuals from I group to Q group, enforcing better implementation of precautionary measures and control of contagion. The results are shown in figure 7. Even in this case, more than 75 percent of the population will contract the disease and the death toll will remain very heavy. Only by combining this scenario with previous scenarios, one can be hopeful to control the epidemic and save lives.

Unlike the current approach in some countries, where only the symptomatic cases are tested, the authorities should provide intensive and extensive testing and try to identify almost-all infected cases. This process would identify asymptomatic but infected cases and stop them of spreading the virus. This is key for a successful containment policy. Given the geographic distribution of the pandemic, the testing should focus on the most affected locations first and then expand to those people who have visited the hot spots or have been in contact with anyone in those areas, while everyone practice social distancing. A combination policy, as discussed above, not only reduces the number of infected, and ultimately the death toll, but it shorten the shelter-in-place period and consequently lowers the economic cost."
34766,How to evaluate the success of the COVID-19 measures implemented by the Norwegian government by analyzing changes in doubling time,"Strict measures implemented in many countries around the world, in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, have put strains on the economy and immobilized the normal functioning of society. Never before in peace time has the modern world seen widespread travel bans, closed borders, home working, and shutdowns of schools and kindergartens. But do these measures successfully slow down and reduce the spread of COVID-19? Is it possible to follow infection trends in real-time to help government officials make well-informed decisions in order to contain the pandemic? Here we describe a method that allows close monitoring of trends that otherwise may not be apparent based on data from standard statistics of cases. By measuring the increase in doubling time, an indicator of how quickly the number of cases is multiplying, we can gain important insights from the COVID-19 epidemiologic data."
34766,How to evaluate the success of the COVID-19 measures implemented by the Norwegian government by analyzing changes in doubling time,"In order to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak, on March 12 th , 2020 the Norwegian government implemented the most drastic measures since World War 2 5 . Schools and kindergartens were closed, flights were cancelled, public gatherings were postponed and citizens with symptoms were advised to self-quarantine for 14 days. Citizens that had been abroad were required to stay at home with their families for 14 days. On March 16 th , 2020, the country was officially shut down for travel with strict control of borders. Denmark implemented even stronger measures, with many shops such as IKEA being required to close as well. In the Norwegian capital Oslo, pubs and restaurants are still open, although with a much lower number of visitors than usual. In Norway, companies that could move their employees over to working from home were advised to do so. Iceland and Finland implemented similar measures, while Sweden closed some, but not all, schools. Sweden also recently introduced travel bans."
34766,How to evaluate the success of the COVID-19 measures implemented by the Norwegian government by analyzing changes in doubling time,What has been the impact of shutting down society and encouraging social distancing on the spread of the disease? Are these measures effective?
34766,How to evaluate the success of the COVID-19 measures implemented by the Norwegian government by analyzing changes in doubling time,"However positive and encouraging these findings are, it is clear that the DTs in Nordic countries are nowhere close to the corresponding values on the South Korean curve. The exception is Denmark which had DT values of approximately 9-10 days and seems to be fighting the epidemic most strictly. In order to drastically reduce the number of infections in the same way South Korea did, there needs to be more effort on the part of Nordic countries. Should these countries attempt to replicate South Korean example more accurately, the measures currently implemented need to be supplemented by more COVID-19 testing and the widespread use of face masks (which are currently not available)."
34766,How to evaluate the success of the COVID-19 measures implemented by the Norwegian government by analyzing changes in doubling time,"The pleasant Spring weather of the past few days appears to have encouraged many people in Oslo to venture out to city parks, neighboring forests and recreation areas. Collectively, nobody is wearing masks, people are crowding together and are not practicing social distancing. Will this behavior reverse the positive trend that has been building for the past week? From here it can go both ways. Is it going to get worse before it gets better?"
34775,COVID-19 Modelling: the Effects of Social Distancing,"Next, we consider the effect of social distancing. This can readily be implemented in the model simply by redefining the basic reproduction number, R 0 at the day the measures are implemented to reflect a sufficient decline in how many people each shedding or symptomatic person will infect. On one extreme we have perfect social distancing with R 0 = 0 but we also investigate the effect of R 0 = 0.5 and R = 0.75."
34775,COVID-19 Modelling: the Effects of Social Distancing,Day 55 is used for initiating social distancing since the simulations here showed 337 dead and 5486 sick consistent with reported numbers on 23 March 2020 when the United Kingdom initiated lockdown. In the case of perfect social distancing the mortality rate is only 0.04% (21474 dead) and the epidemic is resolved by day 90 with the number of people sick peaking on day 70.
34775,COVID-19 Modelling: the Effects of Social Distancing,In the case of a more relaxed social distancing with R 0 = 0.50 the mortality rate is 0.13% (79781 dead) without having the epidemic resolved by day 250 and with the number of people sick peaking on day 71. A somewhat stricter social distancing with R 0 = 0.25 would resolve the epidemic by day 189 and lead to 32998 dead.
34775,COVID-19 Modelling: the Effects of Social Distancing,"Finally, if the social distancing is relaxed to R 0 = 0.75 we observe a much later peak in the number of people sick on day 112 and also a much larger mortality rate of 0.55% (330964 dead)."
34775,COVID-19 Modelling: the Effects of Social Distancing,"However, the UK has not taken this approach and has instead decided to adopt a social distancing approach and go on lockdown. If UK's lockdown goes perfectly (as shown in Figure 5 ), the pandemic will be resolved in roughly 1.5 months with only 21, 000 dead. However, seeing as UK is only going on a semi-lockdown (with e.g. many people still going to work and using public transportation), the likelihood of this seems very low. It seems much more likely that the result of this semi-lockdown looks more like Figure 6 , with 4.5 months of doing this semi-lockdown and with approximately 80, 000 dead."
34794,"A Territory-wide study of COVID-19 cases and clusters with unknown source in Hong Kong community: A clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic investigation","In conclusion, phylogenetic and phylodynamic data were consistent with the epidemiological finding that an active community outbreak is occurring in Hong Kong although the clinical presentations of the confirmed cases were generally mild. Vigilant infection control measures, such as rapid isolation of suspected or confirmed cases and their close contacts, and social distancing should be maintained to contain further transmission of COVID-19 in the community."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Social distancing, or practices which reduce the probability of contact between infected and non-infected people, has emerged as the primary tool for reducing the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.(1; 2; 3) As of March 2020, other methods for fighting infectious disease are mostly unavailable or ineffective due to the characteristics of this pathogen: (1) it is an emergent virus to which there is no pre-existing immunity, available vaccine, or proven treatment;"
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"(3) those affected may be contagious during a prolonged asymptomatic incubation period, and many never develop symptoms distinctive from a mild flu, making it difficult to identify and isolate the infected before they pass the virus to others. (4) Broad public mandates for social distancing are also vital to help manage a key multiplier of COVID-19 fatality rates: a substantial fraction of patients require lengthy (on average 8 bed days) intensive care unit (ICU) support to survive acute respiratory distress, and uncontrolled spread of the disease is expected to generate at its peak far greater demand for ICU care than existing capacity can meet.(5; 2; 6) Public health experts have pleaded with officials to quickly mandate social distancing to flatten the curve of coronavirus infections -that is, reduce the peak caseload -before exponential case growth leads to hundreds of thousands or millions of deaths. In particular, it is important to keep peak levels low to prevent the fatality rate from rising to the levels seen in areas where hospitals are overwhelmed with cases. (7) In the United States, the emergence of the coronavirus has created a natural experiment in which elected officials face incredibly urgent and far-reaching policy decisions for which they typically have no personal experience or expertise, and for which the history of policy examples is either mere days old, or so dated as to be largely unknown except by public health experts. The most significant policy decisions of this kindboth in terms of their potential to mitigate the epidemic and their economic consequences -are mandates for social distancing through restrictions on public gatherings; closure or restriction of schools, restaurants, and other non-essential businesses; and orders for the public to stay at home. (8) Under the federal and state constitutions, the key actions fall to executives, and particularly to governors, whose powers in public health emergencies are typically singular and extensive."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"In particular, the exponential growth of cases of an emergent virus has unique implications for policy making. Estimates of the uncontrolled doubling-time of COVID-19 cases vary and are complicated by the slow rollout of effective testing in the US, but many studies find doubling times in the range from four to seven days.(9; 10; 3; 2) These estimates correspond to alarming growth rates of 10.4% to 26.0% per day. Even if the true doubling time of infections prior to social distancing is as long as a week, delaying these measures just three days would, all else equal, raise the eventual peak number of cases by more than 30%, potentially increasing total deaths by thousands or more in a given state."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Evidence from the 1918 influenza pandemic underscores the stakes for elected officials. In that earlier natural experiment, American cities faced similar decisions regarding social distancing policies. For example, Philadelphia decided to hold a parade welcoming soldiers returning from World War I, while St. Louis cancelled its parade, and ultimately experienced one eighth as many deaths per capita during that wave of influenza. The height of the infection in Saint Louis was two months later than in Philadelphia, and was far lower, with deaths peaking at fifty per hundred thousand rather than 250 per hundred thousand.(11; 12) Shortly after community transmission of the coronavirus was discovered in Washington and California in late February 2020, public health experts drew the comparison between Philadelphia and Saint Louis, hoping to inspire policymakers to promote social distancing. Nevertheless, in an echo of the decisions made a century before, there are significant differences in the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. For instance, on 6 March 2020, after Kentucky had its first confirmed case of COVID-19, Governor Andy Beshear (D) immediately called a state of emergency, encouraged social distancing, and closed bars and restaurants ten days later. But when neighboring Tennesse uncovered its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 5th, Governor Bill Lee (R) waited until 12 March to declare a state of emergency and finally closed restaurants and bars on 22 March. (13) Why did governors' responses to a sudden, shared threat differ? Under normal circumstances, governors' policy decisions are shaped by the national leaders and agenda of their political party and the demands of their own constituents, particularly those in their partisan base. Governors may also look to innovative peers and neighbors for examples to follow. But the fast-moving nature of the coronavirus threat, the need to rely on experts to understand complex scientific material, and uncertainty about the nature and scope of the threat might scramble all or some of these usual motivations. pandemic politics · Adolph, Amano, Bang-Jensen, Fullman & Wilkerson The public health case for mandatory social distancing in the United States developed quickly in the wake of the first reports of community transmission on 26 February in Washington state. One might expect social distancing measures to quickly follow across the fifty states, perhaps more quickly in states with greater number of confirmed cases. But mandating social distancing is a difficult decision for any political leader. If these measures are successful in preventing widespread mortality, many members of the public who suffered the costs of these mandates may never fully comprehend the benefits. Indeed, the more successful the intervention, the more likely it will appear to many as an ""overreaction."" Moreover, some states faced higher potential costs from these policies: closing schools is more painful in states where more children depend on schools for subsidized lunches and shutting restaurants and public places is more difficult in states highly dependent on tourism. (14) More generally, states with more limited economic resources are likely far less able to weather the deprivations caused by economic shutdowns, or to expand social insurance protections during mandated social distancing, and thus may be considerably more reluctant to take these steps."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"But the greatest barrier to swift social distancing measures seems political. Numerous surveys have found significant partisan divides in public opinion about the severity of the coronavirus threat. (15; 16) Countering the message from public health leaders, the White House downplayed COVID-19. On 4 March 2020, President Trump insisted that COVID-19 was similar to the flu; two days later, he falsely claimed the situation in Italy was improving, and that the US was handling coronavirus much better than other industrialized countries. As late as 15 March 2020, with reported cases rising rapidly, Trump still maintained that the epidemic within the US was under control.(17) Similar messages filled news sources relied on by Republican voters. Fox Business host Trish Reagan insisted the pandemic warnings were a Democratic hoax and another effort to impeach the President, while Sean Hannity, another Fox News personality, validated the conspiracy theory that coronavirus was an effort by the ""deep state"" to ""manipulate markets, suppress dissent and push mandated medicines."" (18) For governors already reluctant to impose draconian measures, this messaging both provided cover for inaction and may have reduced public support, particularly among Republican voters. And as social distancing measures have spread, Republican leaders, including Trump, have been more vocal in their desire to quickly rollback these measures to restore the economy."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Moving beyond general impressions of the determinants of social distancing poses challenges: States with Democratic governors and voters tend to be both richer than Republican states, and to be more urban and coastal. The seemingly quicker action of pandemic politics · Adolph, Amano, Bang-Jensen, Fullman & Wilkerson ""blue states"" could simply be a result of the coronavirus first emerging in cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and New York, as well as in states better able to endure prolonged social distancing mandates. Likewise, disentangling the role of Republican governors from Republican voters is challenging, though some blue states, like Maryland, have Republican governors (and vice versa)."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"To investigate why some states acted quickly to implement social distancing while others took longer, we identified five critical areas of social distancing policy -recommendations and restrictions against public gatherings, mandatory school closures, restrictions on the normal operation of restaurants, closure of non-essential businesses, and stay-at-home orders -and collected the dates each state first announced such measures. Our primary objective is to explain the variation in timing of these measures across states using an event history analysis. This approach allows us to statistically separate the impact of having a Republican governor or a Republican electorate from a series of potential confounders, including the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state, state income, and cases and policies in neighboring states."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Our findings are unambiguous: political variables are the strongest predictor of the early adoption of social distancing policies. All else equal, states with Republican governors and Republican electorates delayed each social distancing measure by an average of 2.70 days (95% CI: 2.49 to 2.88), a far larger effect than any other factor, including state income per capita, the percentage of neighboring states with mandates, or even confirmed cases in each state."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"We study state social distancing measures enacted over the period from the first reported case of transmission in the US on 26 February 2020 up through 23 March 2020, at which point all states had at least one social distancing policy. 1 To capture variation in these policies across states over time, we draw on data compiled by the National Governors' Association (NGA), which we verified and further documented by collect- 1 We consider the first community transmission in the US more epidemiologically and politically relevant than initial reported transmission in each state. At the time of first community transmission in the US, virologists including Trevor Bedford suggested this strain had been circulating in Washington state since mid-January. (19) Given scarce and unreliable testing, governors faced a choice to either take immediate action as national cases increased or wait for (potentially belated) reports of in-state cases. We prefer to treat the decision to wait for a confirmed case as something to be explained, and so control for confirmed in-state cases in our model."

34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Although we also coded implementation dates for each of these policies, our focus is on the dates policies were announced, for two reasons. First, we expect much of the effect of these emergency measures on social behavior to be immediate. The state's power to compel socially responsible behavior is often said to act through ""quasi-voluntary compliance,"" in which most citizens choose pro-social behaviors given a cue from the state that is backed with the threat of sanction. (21) This effect should be all the stronger to the extent people treat costly social distancing measures as a credible signal of the viral threat. Second, our focus is on predicting the timing of governor's actions, which naturally points to announcement dates, rather than implementation dates which may be delayed (in the case of school closures, for example), by weekends and spring breaks. Figure 1 displays the timing of different states' adoptions of these five social distancing policies over the four-week study period. No state acted before 10 March, a full thirteen days after the first report of community transmission, yet by 15 March, uptake was rapid across states. In general, states typically started social distancing through recommendations or restrictions on public gatherings, then turned to restrictions on schools 2 We include recommendations in this category for two reasons: first, this was often the first action states took, and early actors did not always revisit these policies with a restrictive mandate; second, the target of these measures was typically large events that would be unlikely to maintain viable attendance under the cloud of a state recommendation to cancel events."

Finally, a minority of states have added closures of non-essential business and stay-at-home orders. By the end of our study period, all states except Arkansas and Mississippi had recommended against or restricted public gatherings, 44 states had closed schools and restricted restaurant operations, nineteen states closed non-essential businesses, and fourteen states issued stay-at-home orders. The final plot on the bottom right highlights the rapid growth in states enacting multiple social distancing measures, as well as the presence of a substantial number of laggard states still lacking most social distancing policies as late as 23 March 2020."

(22) In our application, this approach allows us to examine the common factors affecting implementation of social distancing across states by 1) pooling the five social distancing measures shown in Figure 1 in a single model, (2) stratifying baseline hazards across the five policy types to allow for varying underlying tendencies to adopt some policies more quickly than others, and (3) clustering standard errors by state."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"As usual, the Cox model allows us to estimate a baseline hazard rate, which shifts in proportion to changes in covariates, and accommodates right-censored cases (states that have not yet adopted a given social distancing measure at the end of the study period). The baseline hazard rate also captures any purely national trends, such as the common tendency of states to adopt social distancing policies as national deaths climb or public awareness of COVID-19 increases, while leaving cross-state variation to be explained by covariates."

34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"We review the determinants of delays in state-level COVID-19 social distancing measures in order of substantive impact, quantifying the impact of each factor in two ways. First, we show the degree to which each factor -such as governors' partisanship, the presence of Trump voters, or actions by neighboring states -reduces the chance a state acts to impose a new social distancing mandate on a given date (Figure 2 ; see Appendix for tabular results). This is the well-known hazard ratio, a common summary of event history models. Second, we use our estimated model to simulate the average delay each factor would cause if it were present in each state. That is, we might ask: if every state had a Republican governor, how many days later would they have implemented each social distancing measure than if every state had a Democratic governor.

At the same time, holding constant the Governor's party affiliation, states with more Trump voters were less likely to adopt social distancing. A state at the 75th percentile of 2016 Trump vote share was 28.1% (95% CI: 1.1 to 49.3) less likely to adopt an additional mandate at a given time when compared to a state at the 25th percentile of Trump support, which resulted in an average delay of 0.99 days (95% CI: 0.93 to 1.07). Republican governors often go together with Trump-voting electorates; on average, these states endured a combined partisan delay of 2.70 days (95% CI: 2.49 to 2.88). Barring positive developments in the fight against COVID-19, the public health impact of this delay is likely to be massive: in a state where coronavirus infections are doubling every seven days, this would raise the peak caseload by 30.6%. In a state where infections are doubling every three days, Republican partisanship might raise the peak level of cases by 86.6%."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Confirmed state-level caseload had only a small effect on social distancing timing. Controlling for partisanship, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in a state had only a small effect on the implementation of social distancing measures. (We emphasize this measure captures state-level cases: the total national cases are captured non-parametrically by the baseline hazard.) To show just how small this effect is, we compare a state with just four confirmed cases (the median among all state-days in our study period) to a state with 426 cases (the 95th percentile). The state with fewer cases was just 12.2% (95% CI: 6.5 to 17.8) less likely to implement social distancing on a given day, for a cumulative delay of just 0.38 days (95% CI: 0.36 to 0.41). While many of the early epicenters were Democratic-leaning states, it does not appear that the more aggressive action of Democratic states is a simple function of caseload. 5 This is, from a public health perspective, a fairly reasonable result: early implementation of social distancing is likely to be far more effective, so pro-active governors may have realized there was little sense in waiting for a certain threshold of cases to act, especially given delays and failures in testing."

34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Neighboring state actions increase the likelihood of social distancing policy. As in other policy areas, governors may look to their peers to determine appropriate action. The policy diffusion literature suggests different ways to determine each state's ""peer group."" Because the coronavirus spreads spatially, we focus on actions by neighboring states, and estimate the likelihood a state will implement a specific kind of social distancing as a function of the percentage of contiguous states also mandating that policy. We find that a state with no neighbors adopting a given policy was 32.0% (95% CI: 8.4 to 50.8) less likely to adopt it than a state with 50% or more of its neighbors adopting that policy. This corresponds to a delay of 1.20 days (95% CI: 1.13 to 1.26). Investigation of other possible mechanisms -including policy diffusion based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in neighboring states or based on the actions of peers a given state typically looks to for policy innovations -failed to uncover additional patterns of diffusion. We speculate that actions by neighboring states may grant cover to governors to take similar actions.(28)"

We strongly believe that realistic assessments of decision-making by elected officials must take electoral motivations and career ambitions seriously -as impolitic as that may be. Elected officials, regardless of party, must be responsive to the concerns of their voters and party leaders. However this essential feature of democratic representation does not inevitably produce the best policy outcome. Where the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were concerned, Republicans had fewer incentives to act quickly than Democrats. First,"

Indeed, Republican voters were more concerned about Ebola during Obama's presidency than they were about COVID-19 under Trump. (38) Second, all humans have difficulty accurately assessing risks that are small but not zero. (39; 40) In this case, Republican voters were more likely than Democrats to incorrectly assume that the COVID-19 fatality rate and disease burden was effectively the same as the flu.(15) Third, partisans' worldviews are shaped by cues provided by their leaders. (34) In the early stages of the US pandemic, President Trump strongly signaled in press conference and on social media that the coronavirus was an exaggerated threat or even a hoax, a position that was magnified and reinforced by Republican-leaning media outlets. Finally, Republican officials almost surely considered the possibility of reprisals -both to their political careers and discretionary federal assistance to their states -from a president who frequently attacks members of his own party that he perceives to be disloyal. (41; 42; 43) To be clear, we are not arguing that politics was the sole motivation behind governors' social distancing decisions: our results suggest otherwise. However, we do believe that the political headwinds were significantly greater for Republican Governors in Republican leaning states."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"It is likely that governors will face this difficult decision again. Governors may choose to roll back social distancing at different points in time. Some experts contend that authorities will need to alternate between two months of social distancing and one month of restored freedoms to reduce the likelihood that health systems are overwhelmed by severe cases until a vaccine is developed, produced, and circulated. (3; 44) This implies state governments will be asked to impose difficult social distancing policies not once, but many times. Each instance will be a test of whether states can act promptly to prevent COVID-19 cases from peaking at unmanageable levels. If Republican governors and states with Republican majorities continue to lag behind, the cumulative impact on those states, and on the country as whole through spillovers, could be vast. Baseline hazards are stratified across the five pooled social distancing measures: recommendations and restrictions on gatherings, school closures, restaurant restrictions, non-essential business closures, and stay-at-home orders. Each row shows the hazard ratio for (the counterfactual change in) the covariate listed at the left. Counterfactual changes are chosen to simplify comparison of hazard ratios for covariates with different scales of measurement. Covariates with both 95% confidence limits below 1.0 significantly reduce the chance of adopting an additional social distancing measure. Standard errors used to compute confidence intervals are clustered by state. The concordance index shows the proportion of all pairs of states for which the model correctly predicts which state will adopt a given social distancing mandate first.

The individual contacts within the population, and possible transmission pathways, are established from a simulation of daily activities that are calibrated with micro-census data. Various governmental interventions with regards to closures and social distancing are also implemented. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus is based on publicly available statistical data and adapted to Swiss demographics. The predictions estimate that between 22 February and 11 April 2020, there will be 720 deaths from 83'300 COVID-19 cases, and 73'300 will have recovered; our preliminary variability in these estimates is about 21% over the aforementioned period. In the absence of governmental intervention, 42.7% of the Swiss population would have been infected by 25 April 2020 compared to our prediction of a 1% infection over this time period, saving thousands of lives. It is argued that future scenarios regarding relaxation of the lockdown should be carefully simulated, as by 19 April 2020, there will still remain a substantial number of infected individuals, who could retrigger a second spread of COVID-19. Through the use of a digital tool, such as Enerpol, to evaluate in a data-driven manner the impacts of various policy scenarios, the most effective measures to mitigate a spread of COVID-19 can be devised while we await the deployment of large-scale vaccination for the population globally. By tailoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of the spread to match the capacity of local healthcare facilities, appropriate logistic needs can be determined, in order not to overwhelm the health care services across the country."

34803,How will this continue? Modelling interactions between the COVID-19 pandemic and policy responses,"The use of detailed simulation modelling to assess the potential outcomes of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its associated disease, COVID-19, has produced crucial information for policy makers and healthcare managers, most notably in the UK where a detailed modelling study (Ferguson et al. 2020 ) has led to a significant change in government policy regarding the pandemic (Gallagher 2020) . The model used, an adaptation of one that was previously used to model potential influenza pandemics (Ferguson et al. 2006) , is a complex individual-based simulation with many thousand lines of code which are not yet available openly ( Tweet from @neil_ferguson 22nd March 2020 ). While such models can make accurate predictions for given assumptions on individual behaviour, their computationally intensive nature means that they do not easily capture a major source of uncertainty determining disease dynamics: when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as social distancing measures are enacted by governments and how the population change their behaviour as a result. To address this aspect of the problem, we propose to use simpler models and perform ""Management Strategy Evaluation"" (MSE: (Bunnefeld, Hoshino & Milner-Gulland 2011; Punt et al. 2016) , an adaptive framework for comparing multiple management strategies in a variety of circumstances. Originally developed for assessing fisheries management schemes, this framework has the potential to be applied widely for assessing best practice in other important management scenarios (Bunnefeld et al. 2011 ) ."
34803,How will this continue? Modelling interactions between the COVID-19 pandemic and policy responses,"The strategies considered in this study are only a small subset of the conceivable approaches to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, we did not include the possibility of contact tracing, which can reduce the need for social distancing measures when the number of infected individuals is low, although the resources required to do this during a pandemic make it unlikely to be used on a large scale (Wu et al. 2006 ) . On the other hand, our model did not consider the uncertainty decision makers face regarding the actual number of infected individuals at a given time. Our simulation code, which we provide alongside this paper, is easily modified to model the long-term implications of these and other considerations. We invite planners to adapt it to investigate the specific questions they face."

To control the epidemic, the Chinese government has enacted a range of social distancing strategies, such as city-wide lockdowns, screening measures at train stations and airports, active case finding, and isolation of suspected cases. The numbers of cases and deaths continue to accumulate every day. However, 2 of 9 the transmission appears to be slowing down outside Hubei due to strict lockdowns combined with isolation and quarantine measures [1] [2] [3] ."

36881,COVID-19 control in China during mass population movements at New Year,"Limiting the social contacts of these individuals was crucial for COVID19 control, because patients with no or mild symptoms can spread the virus. 5 Government policies enacted during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday are likely to have helped reduce the spread of the virus by decreasing contact and increasing physical distance between those who have COVID19 and those who do not. As part of these social distancing policies, the Chinese Government encouraged people to stay at home; discouraged mass gatherings; cancelled or postponed large public events; and closed schools, universities, government offices, libraries, museums, and factories. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Only limited segments of urban public transport systems remained operational and all crossprovince bus routes were taken out of service. As a result of these policies and public information and education campaigns, Chinese citizens started to take measures to protect themselves against COVID19, such as staying at home as far as possible, limiting social contacts, and wearing protective masks when they needed to move in public."
36881,COVID-19 control in China during mass population movements at New Year,"Social distancing has been effective in past disease epidemics, curbing humantohuman transmission and reducing morbidity and mortality. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] A single social distancing policy can cut epidemic spread, but usually multiple such policies-including more restrictive mea sures such as isolation and quarantine-are implemented in combination to boost effectiveness. For example, during the 1918-19 influenza pandemic, the New York City Department of Health enforced several social distancing policies at the same time, including staggered business hours, compulsory isolation, and quarantine, which likely led to New York City suffering the lowest death rate from influenza on the eastern seaboard of the USA. 17 During the current outbreak of COVID19, government officials and researchers were concerned that the mass movement of people at the end of the Lunar New Year holiday on Jan 31, 2020, would exacerbate the spread of COVID19 across China. Moreover, individuals typically return from their Lunar New Year holiday after only 1 week, which is shorter than the longest suspected incubation period of the disease. 18 Many of the 5 million people who left Wuhan before the travel ban was put into place 3 could still have been latently infected when their holiday ended. This situation, together with the resumed travel activities, would make it difficult to contain the outbreak."
36881,COVID-19 control in China during mass population movements at New Year,"Facing these concerns, the Chinese Government ex tended the Lunar New Year holiday. The holiday end date was changed to March 10 for Hubei province 19 and Feb 9 for many other provinces, so that the duration of the holiday would be sufficiently long to fully cover the suspected incubation period of COVID19. [20] [21] [22] In addition, people diagnosed with COVID19 were isolated in hospitals. In Wuhan, where the largest number of infected people live, those with mild and asymptomatic infection were also quarantined in socalled shelter or ""Fang Cang"" hospitals, which are public spaces such as stadiums and conference centres that have been repurposed for medical care. Finally, the Chinese Government encouraged and supported grassroots activities for routine screening, contact tracing, and early detection and medical care of COVID19 patients, and it promoted hand washing, surface disinfection, and the use of protective masks through social marketing and media. As a result of the extended holiday and the additional measures, many people with asymptomatic infection from Hubei province who had travelled to other provinces remained in their homes until they developed symptoms, at which point they received treatment. It is this homebased quarantine of people who had been to the epicentre of the epidemic and travelled to other locations in China that is likely to have been especially helpful in curbing the spread of the virus to the wider community."
36881,COVID-19 control in China during mass population movements at New Year,"First, countries facing potential spread of COVID19, or a similar outbreak in the future, should consider outbreak control ""holidays"" or closure periods-ie, periods of recommended or mandatory closure of nonessential workplaces and public insti tutions-as a firstline social distancing measure to slow the rate of transmission. Second, governments should tailor the design of such outbreakcontrol closure periods to the specific epidemic characteristics of the novel disease, such as the incubation period and transmission routes. Third, a central goal of an outbreakcontrol closure period is to prevent people with asymptomatic infections from spreading the disease. As such, governments should use the closure period for information and education campaigns, community screening, active contact tracing, and isolation and quarantine to maximise impact. Such a combination approach is also supported by studies of responses to previous outbreaks, which showed that reductions in the cumulative attack rate were more pronounced when social distancing policies were combined with other epidemic control measures to block transmission. 23 As for COVID19 in China, this combination of an outbreakcontrol closure period for social distancing and a range of accompanying epidemic control measures seems to have prevented new infections, especially in provinces other than Hubei, where new infections have been declining for more than 2 weeks. 1 As fearsome and consequential as the COVID19 outbreak has been, China's vigorous, multifaceted response is likely to have prevented a far worse situation. Future empirical research will establish the full impact of the social distancing and epidemic control policies during the extended Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. As travel and work slowly resume in China, the country should consider at least partial continuation of these policies to ensure that the COVID19 outbreak is sustainably controlled."
38395,How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?,"What has happened in China shows that quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic. 1 This impact of the COVID-19 response in China is encouraging for the many countries where COVID-19 is beginning to spread. However, it is unclear whether other countries can implement the stringent measures China eventually adopted. Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002-03, provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals."
38395,How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?,"The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or more precisely the area under the epidemic curve. For an epidemic to take hold, the value of R 0 must be greater than unity in value. A simple calculation gives the fraction likely to be infected without mitigation. This fraction is roughly 1-1/R 0 . With R 0 values for COVID-19 in China around 2·5 in the early stages of the epidemic, 2 we calculate that approximately 60% of the population would become infected. This is a very worst-case scenario for a number of reasons. We are uncertain about transmission in children, some communities are remote and unlikely to be exposed, voluntary social distancing by individuals and communities will have an impact, and mitigation efforts, such as the measures put in place in China, greatly reduce transmission. As an epidemic progresses, the effective reproduction number (R) declines until it falls below unity in value when the epidemic peaks and then decays, either due to the exhaustion of people susceptible to infection or the impact of control measures."
38395,How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?,"So what is left at present for mitigation is voluntary plus mandated quarantine, stopping mass gatherings, closure of educational institutes or places of work where infection has been identified, and isolation of households, towns, or cities. Some of the lessons from analyses of influenza A apply for COVID-19, but there are also differences. Social distancing measures reduce the value of the effective reproduction number R. With an early epidemic value of R 0 of 2·5, social distancing would have to reduce transmission by about 60% or less, if the intrinsic transmission potential declines in the warm summer months in the northern hemisphere. This reduction is a big ask, but it did happen in China."
38395,How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?,"School closure, a major pillar of the response to pandemic influenza A, 14 is unlikely to be effective given the apparent low rate of infection among children, although data are scarce. Avoiding large gatherings of people will reduce the number of super-spreading events; however, if prolonged contact is required for transmission, this measure might only reduce a small proportion of transmissions. Therefore, broader-scale social distancing is likely to be needed, as was put in place in China. This measure prevents transmission from symptomatic and non-symptomatic cases, hence flattening the epidemic and pushing the peak further into the future. Broader-scale social distancing provides time for the health services to treat cases and increase capacity, and, in the longer term, for vaccines and treatments to be developed. Containment could be targeted to particular areas, schools, or mass gatherings. This approach underway in northern Italy will provide valuable data on the effectiveness of such measures. The greater the reduction in transmission, the longer and flatter the epidemic curve (figure), with the risk of resurgence when interventions are lifted perhaps to mitigate economic impact."
38395,How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?,The key epidemiological issues that determine the impact of social distancing measures are what proportion of infected individuals have mild symptoms and whether these individuals will self-isolate and to what effectiveness; how quickly symptomatic individuals take to isolate themselves after the onset of symptoms; and the duration of any non-symptomatic infectious period before clear symptoms occur with the linked issue of how transmissible COVID-19 is during this phase.
38395,How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?,"Individual behaviour will be crucial to control the spread of COVID-19. Personal, rather than government action, in western democracies might be the most important issue. Early self-isolation, seeking medical advice remotely unless symptoms are severe, and social distancing are key. Government actions to ban mass gatherings are important, as are good diagnostic facilities and remotely accessed health advice, together with specialised treatment for people with severe disease. Isolating towns or even cities is not yet part of the UK Government action plan. 15 This plan is light on detail, given the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic and the many uncertainties, but it outlines four phases of action entitled contain, delay, research, and mitigate. 15 The UK has just moved from contain to delay, which aims to flatten the epidemic and lower peak morbidity and mortality. If measures are relaxed after a few months to avoid severe economic impact, a further peak is likely to occur in the autumn (figure). Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Iran are at the mitigate phase and trying to provide the best care possible for a rapidly growing number of people with COVID-19."
38395,How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?,"The known epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 point to urgent priorities. Shortening the time from symptom onset to isolation is vital as it will reduce transmission and is likely to slow the epidemic (appendices 2, 3) However, strategies are also needed for reducing household transmission, supporting home treatment and diagnosis, and dealing with the economic consequences of absence from work. Peak demand for health services could still be high and the extent and duration of presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission-if this turns out to be a feature of COVID-19 infection-will determine the success of this strategy. 16 Contact tracing is of high importance in the early stages to contain spread, and model-based estimates suggest, with an R 0 value of 2·5, that about 70% of contacts will have to be successfully traced to control early spread. 17 Analysis of individual contact patterns suggests that contact tracing can be a successful strategy in the early stages of an outbreak, but that the logistics of timely tracing on average 36 contacts per case will be challenging. 17 Super-spreading events are inevitable, and could overwhelm the contact tracing system, leading to the need for broader-scale social distancing interventions."
38395,How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?,"Data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran suggest that the CFR increases sharply with age and is higher in people with COVID-19 and underlying comorbidities. 18 Targeted social distancing for these groups could be the most effective way to reduce morbidity and concomitant mortality. During the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in west Africa in 2014-16, deaths from other causes increased because of a saturated health-care system and deaths of health-care workers. 19 These events underline the importance of enhanced support for health-care infrastructure and effective procedures for protecting staff from infection."
38395,How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?,"A baseline simulation with case isolation only (red); a simulation with social distancing in place throughout the epidemic, flattening the curve (green), and a simulation with more effective social distancing in place for a limited period only, typically followed by a resurgent epidemic when social distancing is halted (blue). These are not quantitative predictions but robust qualitative illustrations for a range of model choices."
38395,How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?,"See Online for appendices 2, 3 R 0 of 2·5 or higher, reductions in transmission by social distancing would have to be large; and much of the changes in transmission of pandemic influenza in the summer of 2009 within Europe were thought to be due to school closures, but children are not thought to be driving transmission of COVID-19. Data from the southern hemisphere will assist in evaluating how much seasonality will influence COVID-19 transmission."
38395,How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID-19 epidemic?,"Model-based predictions can help policy makers make the right decisions in a timely way, even with the uncertainties about COVID-19. Indicating what level of transmission reduction is required for social distancing interventions to mitigate the epidemic is a key activity (figure). However, it is easy to suggest a 60% reduction in transmission will do it or quarantining within 1 day from symptom onset will control transmission, but it is unclear what communication strategies or social distancing actions individuals and governments must put in place to achieve these desired outcomes. A degree of pragmatism will be needed for the implementation of social distancing and quarantine measures. Ongoing data collection and epidemiological analysis are therefore essential parts of assessing the impacts of mitigation strategies, alongside clinical research on how to best manage seriously ill patients with COVID-19."
9833,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"In December, 2019, several health facilities in the Chinese city of Wuhan (Hubei province) reported clusters of individuals with pneumonia 1 whose clinical presentations resembled the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in 2002 in the nearby Guangdong province and led to outbreaks worldwide. 2 On Jan 7, 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was isolated, confirming the circulation of a new respiratory illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , with evidence suggesting that the Huanan seafood wholesale market was the initial transmission site. 3 On Jan 1, 2020, the market was closed for environmental sanitation and disinfection to prevent further transmission. 4 Cases of COVID-19 have since been reported in health-care workers 3 and family clusters in China, 5 with 67 794 cases and 3805 deaths confirmed in Hubei province as of March 15, 2020. 6 Older individuals (aged >60 years) and people with chronic underlying health conditions are particularly susceptible to severe disease. 5 Rapid spread of the virus compelled the Chinese Government to restrict movement in affected cities, with the cessation of public transport 7 and cancellation of flights. 8 Despite extensive efforts to prevent onward spread, 143 countries and territories outside of mainland China have now reported imported cases. 6 Internationally, ongoing local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in 81 countries and territories. 6 In Singapore, 243 individuals have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 121 have been hospitalised and are stable, 13 are in a critical condition, and 109 have been discharged at the time of writing. 9 The first case in Singapore was identified on Jan 23, 2020, and was imported from China; 10 a further 68 cases were imported, with the remaining 175 cases most likely the result of transmission within Singapore. 11 All imported cases were travellers who had returned from Wuhan before Feb 4, 2020, with transmission to close contacts recorded within families at a church and shop in three small transmission clusters. 11 As of March 16, 2020, inpatients with COVID-19 in Singapore are isolated at the hospital they present to or at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, a specialised facility designed to facilitate infectious disease outbreak response. 10 A government-wide taskforce has been established to increase surveillance at borders and prepare the public in terms of awareness and education. 10 The Ministry of Health Singapore has implemented contact tracing efforts to identify potential cases among people travelling with, or in close proximity to, individuals with COVID-19. 12 Despite these efforts and nationwide precautionary measures, including the dispensing of masks to households and public hospital emergency departments being on high alert for an outbreak response, the number of suspected and imported cases in Singapore is expected to increase due to the high volume of incoming travellers. 10 Preliminary estimates indicate that the ascertainment rate in Wuhan is 5•1% (95% CI 4•8-5•5); 13 however, high levels of under-reporting and misdiagnosis due to difficulties in identifying cases make it challenging for policy makers to prepare a large-scale response. Consequently, following the recom mendations made by Wu and colleagues, 14 modelling studies are needed to estimate the potential impact of interventions"
9833,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"This study is the first to investigate the use of isolation for individuals with COVID-19 and quarantine of family members, school closures, and workplace distancing as interventions for the immediate control of COVID-19 in the event of secondary local transmission using a simulation model. We found that a combined approach (incorporating quarantine, school closures, and workplace distancing) could prevent a national outbreak at low levels of infectivity and reduce the number of total infections considerably at higher levels of infectivity. Such control measures should be deployed in countries outside of China with evidence of imported cases and evidence of local transmission."
9833,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"We used FluTE, 15 an agent-based influenza epidemic simulation model, which accounts for demography, host movement, and social contact rates in workplaces, schools, and homes to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should local containment fail. The FluTE simulation model requires a synthetic population to build the contact and transmission network. Therefore, we used the geographical, demographic, and epidemiological model of Singapore (hereafter referred to as GeoDEMOS-R, where R represents respiratory illness), 16 a modelling framework that aims to recreate a synthetic but realistic representation of the Singaporean population at the household and individual level. We generated the synthetic population using national 2010 census data 17, 18 to fit multiple attributes of the population at the household and individual level. The generated households contained demographic characteristics, such as age, marital status, religion, and ethnicity, of household members. Individuals were then allocated to workplaces or educational facilities on the basis of local transportation data and home addresses according to 2010 census data. 19 The contact behaviour of individuals in the area of their home (ie, between family members and their local community; defined as the home community), workplace, and school, where applicable, were recorded with potential transmission events as a function of infectivity. We ran the models for 80 days to investigate the early stages of an epidemic and seeded 100 local cases randomly among the resident population at 0 days, representing a few generations of local transmission at the time of scenario implementation (ie, when contact tracing has failed to identify cases within the community and unknown local transmission has started). A full description of the model is available in the appendix (pp 1-5)."
9833,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"For the baseline scenario (ie, no interventions), we ran 1000 epidemic simulations to account for the stochasticity in infection contact networks and to calculate CIs across time. Four intervention scenarios were proposed for implementation after failure of local containment, following policy options currently being assessed by the Singaporean Ministry of Health, as standard interventions for respiratory virus control: isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of their family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus immediate school closure for 2 weeks; quarantine plus immediate workplace distancing, in which 50% of the workforce is encouraged to work from home for 2 weeks; and a combination of quarantine, immediate school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). Quarantine of infected individuals is expected to occur 1 day after symptom onset in a health-care facility that is assumed to have 3000 beds at maximum capacity (during the early stage of the outbreak) and is fully equipped to handle full quarantine measures (ie, negative pressure isolation rooms, full personal protective equipment use by staff) so that the individual is unable to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other inpatients. At full capacity, the remaining individuals are isolated at home after receiving treatment. Family members of infected individuals are quarantined at home for 14 days and thus are unable to attend work or school or infect the wider community at their residential address. However, transmission within families is possible as a result of the presence of an isolated and infected individual. Each of these intervention scenarios had 1000 simulations in which we additionally recorded the location of infection as the home community, workplace, or school (appendix pp 3-4)."

For the quarantine intervention, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was reduced to 15 000 (800-30 000; table; appendix p 9), which is a 94•8% decrease (90·2-99·7) in the number of infected individuals compared with the baseline scenario.

At higher asymptomatic proportions of 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%, further increases were observed (appendix pp 8, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . We only ran the analysis at higher asymptomatic rates at the lower level of infectivity (R 0 =1·5), because we observed substantial increases in the number of cases observed, reflecting poor case control that would otherwise be exacerbated and lead to containment failure at higher infectivity. When R 0 was 1·5, interventions caused substantial reductions in the number of infections at asymptomatic fractions of 7·5% and 22·7%. For quarantine, by comparison with the number of cases observed for the 7·5% asymptomatic proportion assumption when R 0 was 1·5, the median number of cases increased by 172 000 (IQR 113 000-221 000) for a 30·0% asymptomatic proportion.

9833,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"Concerns about COVID-19 becoming a global epidemic are increasing on the basis of previous epidemics, such as SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and pandemic influenza. The introduction of cases into new countries, regions and cities is likely to continue in areas where local establishment could form, depending on the ongoing level of control measures. In the event that local containment is unsuccessful, our findings suggest that national outbreak control is feasible provided that R 0 is low (≤1•5), with a combination of the proposed inter vention measures (quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing) being most effective. Under this scenario (R 0 =1·5), workplace distancing reduced the median number of cases from 279 000 (IQR 245 000-320 000) to 4000 (200-23 000), as a result of the high employment rates (around 98%) among individuals of working age in Singapore. 25 This observation is consistent with the conclusions of a review of 15 studies that found a median reduction of 23% (range 12-82) in the cumulative influenza A H1N1 attack rate with workplace distancing alone. 26 The implementation of such a control measure, however, is likely to have an acute societal economic effect on individuals who must work from home or take leave, especially if reimbursement is not possible. Thus, decision making becomes a function of risk as to whether the imported cases have or will infect the local population and cause a local outbreak. An R 0 value of 1·5 is not consistent with the evidence from China, 14 and thus prevention of community transmission might not be possible using interventions that would be widely supported by the population. At the start of the outbreak, the risk of repeated importation of SARS-CoV-2 into Singapore was deemed to be considerable given that around 3•4 million people travel from Wuhan to Singapore annually. 27 Furthermore, the start of the epidemic coincided with the 2020 Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, with the expectation that the number of individuals arriving from China would be similar to that for the 2018 celebrations (around 800 000 tourists from China). 27 The high influx of incoming travellers exacerbated the risk of local disease establishment, bringing at least 18 initial confirmed imported cases into Singapore before Feb 4, 2020, when the first four local transmission cases were confirmed. 11 These four cases had contact with at least two infected tourists at a shop, who were identified through intensive contact tracing efforts. Although travel is now reduced, at least 175 subsequent locally-acquired infections have been reported at the time of writing across a diverse range of residential and commercial sites despite efforts by the Singaporean Government to quarantine and isolate infected individuals. On March 16, 2020, 11 of the 17 confirmed cases were imported with travel histories including the UK, Indonesia, Portugal, Spain, the USA, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium. 11 On March 17, 2020, a further 17 of 23 cases were reported to be imported. 11 With the risk of disease establishment remaining high from the continued importation of cases, workplace distancing and school closure remain as critical interventions that can avert a significant number of cases."
9833,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"We found that these two interventions, when used in combination with quarantine, would be highly effective at low infection rates (ie, R 0 of 1·5), with median of 10 000 cases (IQR 200-28 000) observed for school closures and 4000 cases (200-23 000) for workplace distancing compared with 279 000 cases (245 000-320 000) at the baseline. At the highest level of infectivity (R 0 =2·5), substantial reductions were observed with a median of 466 000 cases (IQR 175 000-728 000) observed when school closure was used and 320 000 (116 000-558 000) for workplace distancing compared with 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000-1 249 000) at baseline. However, if the preventive effect of these interventions reduces considerably due to higher asymptomatic proportions, more pressure will be placed on the quarantining and treatment of infected individuals, which could become unfeasible when the number of infected individuals exceeds the capacity of health-care facilities."
9833,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"Scale-up of ongoing surveillance programmes and rigorous contract tracing 12, 28 are thus required to assist in the maintenance of a low number of unidentified infections at this time, with school closure and workplace distancing being potentially effective strategies for deployment nationwide should local transmission, with multiple transmission events recorded between individuals in the resident population, begin. Our simulation model, which examined hypothetical infection spread with 100 unidentified Singaporean cases as a seed population, showed that for the baseline scenario (ie, no control interventions) by day 80, when R 0 was 1·5, around 279 000 individuals would be infected, when R 0 was 2·0, around 727 000 individuals would be infected, and when R 0 was 2·5, around 1 207 000 individuals would be infected. In the event that suppression of transmission through quarantine is unsuccessful and local transmission begins, which has currently been observed in other countries on a small scale, 29, 30 policy makers in Singapore should deploy alternate measures, such as school closure and workplace distancing, in a timely manner. School closure has been used in the past in Singapore to limit the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease, and was associated with a decrease of up to 53% in secondary cases, 31 probably because children generally have high contact rates with their peers in the school environment. Given this historical experience, a similar programme for COVID-19 could be established reasonably quickly. However, at present, data on the susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of infected children in Singapore, and the probability of children becoming symptomatic are limited, making school closure less desirable than workplace distancing."
9833,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"The continually high percentage contribution of workrelated infections despite work distancing being effective suggests that the workplace is a key infection site in Singapore, whereby reductions in workplace transmission averts cases at all other sites. The effects of school closure and quarantine were comparable, since the displacement of students to the home community will then rely on quarantine as a measure of preventing infection. However, asymptomatic cases, assumed to account for 7•5% of the infected population, would continue to contribute to transmission, and the identification of these individuals presents a challenge."
9833,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"Regardless of the proportion of individuals in the population with asymptomatic infection, all the proposed interventions should be used in addition to other measures, such as rapid diagnosis and appropriate case management, if local containment fails. Current government-led outbreak control measures will only be successful with public cooperation through exercising good hygiene, infection prevention in shared spaces, and adequate education to understand when symptoms might be indicative of a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection. Public complicity is particularly crucial for older individuals (>60 years), individuals who are immunocompromised, and people with comorbidities who are at high risk of severe complications. 5 During the 2003 SARS outbreak, 238 probable SARS cases were reported and 33 individuals died in Singapore, with the highest proportion of deaths (45%) reported among people aged 65 years and older. 32 The same observation is thus expected for COVID-19 should local transmission occur since the median age of infection in our models was 37 years (IQR 26-49), with comparatively few children becoming infected because of school closure and awareness among parents to quarantine children with fever. Singapore has one of the highest employment rates among older individuals (aged ≥65 years) of all countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 33 and a culture of eating at socalled hawker centres (ie, food courts), with around 75% of people visiting a hawker centre at least once a week. 34 Consequently, many older people are expected to be exposed to infection at work or within their home communities, which could be mitigated in part by implementation of workplace distancing and, if possible, incentivisation to remain at home and practise workplace distancing, specifically for older individuals."
9833,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"At present, the quarantining of family and close contacts of confirmed cases is crucial, as shown by the substantial increase in infection rates among individuals who shared living spaces and bathrooms during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in China, despite the regular disinfection of these areas. 35 The protocols in place at present, including the use of specialist ambulances, negative pressure isolation rooms, and ultraviolet disinfection, will assist in isolating the infection and preventing transmission events at health-care facilities, as was seen during the 2003 SARS outbreak. 21 Since at least 15 medical staff in Wuhan have contracted the virus, 3 Singapore has provided full personal protective equipment for health-care workers; however, the results of our study suggest that community transmission will substantially contribute to transmission should local containment fail despite these measures. The main control measures at this time are surveillance, standard testing procedures, 36 and quarantine of individuals who are confirmed positive for the virus. Such measures have been used in the past for suspected cases of MERS-CoV, which has a 34•4% casefatality rate, 37 with no cases of MERS-CoV reported in Singapore to date, and for Zika virus, which established locally in 2016, with only ten cases reported in 2019. 38 Such successes in preventing local outbreaks are attributed to robust disease surveillance in Singapore. Nevertheless, dengue outbreaks are ongoing in Singapore, 39 which highlights the difficulties in disease control that are in part due to undocumented spread and individuals who are asymptomatic; these issues are likely to affect the control of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic since many imported cases worldwide have been asymptomatic on entry to countries. 9 The implementation of school closure and workplace distancing can therefore be considered as a potential secondary control response in the event of infection quarantine failure and the establishment of community transmission. increasingly important, with a need to develop vaccines and existing drug therapies."
9833,Interventions to mitigate early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore: a modelling study,"Pandemic planning is crucial at the early stages to avert a nationwide outbreak. In this study, we investigated the use of interventions that aim to restrict contact between individuals at important mixing sites: schools, workplaces, and at home. We found that, especially for lower infection scenarios (R 0 of 1·5), a combined approach comprising quarantine (for infected individuals and their families), school closure, and workplace distancing is effective and could prevent 99·3% of infections (IQR 92•6-99•9) when compared with the baseline scenario. At higher infectivity scenarios, outbreak prevention becomes considerably more challenging because although effective, transmission events still occur: for the combined approach scenario, a median of 50 000 cases were estimated at R 0 of 2·0 and 258 000 cases at R 0 of 2·5. These combined interventions should therefore be implemented rapidly upon confirmation of second-generation local transmission occurring within the resident population to suppress increases in the national R 0 .

Under this policy, medical institutes can adopt isolation treatment and observation protocols to prevent and control the spread of the COVID-19. On 22 January 2020, the National Health Commission published national guidelines for the prevention and control of COVID-19 for medical institutes to prevent nosocomial infection [46] . On 28 January 2020, the National Health Commission issued protocols for rapid prevention and control measures in order to effectively contain the spread of the epidemic through a ""big isolation and big disinfection"" policy during the Chinese Spring Festival [47] . National-level strategies have also been issued with targeted measures for rural areas (issued on 28 January 2020) and the elderly population (issued on 31 January 2020) [48, 49] . Several public health measures that may prevent or slow down the transmission of the COVID-19 were introduced; these include case isolation, identification and follow-up of contacts, environmental disinfection, and use of personal protective equipment [50] ."

Regarding patients infected with COVID-19, it has been recommended to apply appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care [3, 16] . There are six clinical trials registered in both the International Clinical Trials Registry platform and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry to evaluate the efficacy or safety of targeted medicine in the treatment or prognosis of COVID-19 (Additional file 2) [51, 52] . Regarding infected patients with COVID-19, it has been recommended to apply appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care [3, 16] . Studies have also explored the prevention of nosocomial infection and psychological health issues associated with COVID-19. A series of measures have been suggested to reduce nosocomial infection, including knowledge training for prevention and control, isolation, disinfection, classified protections at different degrees in infection areas, and protection of confirmed cases [18, 50, 53] . Concerning psychological health, some suggested psychological intervention for confirmed cases, suspected cases, and medical staff [18, 54] . For the general population, at this moment there is no vaccine preventing COVID-19. The best prevention is to avoid being exposed to the virus [55] . Airborne precautions and other protective measures have been discussed and proposed for prevention. Infection preventive and control (IPC) measures that may reduce the risk of exposure include the following: use of face masks; covering coughs and sneezes with tissues that are then safely disposed of (or, if no tissues are available, use a flexed elbow to cover the cough or sneeze); regular hand washing with soap or disinfection with hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (if soap and water are not available); avoidance of contact with infected people and maintaining an appropriate distance as much as possible; and refraining from touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands [3] ."

In this document, health care workers are recommended to use particulate respirators such as those certified N95 or FFP2 when performing aerosol-generating procedures and to use medical masks while providing any care to suspected or confirmed cases. According to this guideline, individuals with respiratory symptoms are advised to use medical masks both in health care and home care settings properly following the infection prevention guidelines.

33772,"The Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is Highly Contagious and More Infectious Than Initially Estimated","Fortunately, we see evidence that control efforts have a measurable effect on the rate of spread. Since January 23, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province implemented vigorous control measures, such as closing down transportation and mass gatherings in the city; whereas, other provinces also escalated the public health alert level and implemented strong control measures. We noted that the growth rate of the daily number of new cases in provinces outside of Hubei slowed down gradually since late January (Fig. 3B) . Due to the closure of Wuhan (and other cities in Hubei), the number of cases reported in other provinces during this period shall start to track local infection dynamics rather than imports from Wuhan. We estimated that the exponential growth rate is decreased to 0.14 per day (CI: 0.12 to 0.15 per day) since January 30. Based on this growth rate and an R0 between 4.7 to 6.6 before the control measures, a calculation following the formula in Ref. (14) suggested that a growth rate decreasing from 0.29 per day to 0.14 per day translates to a 50%-59% decrease in R0 to between 2.3 to 3.0. This is in agreement with previous estimates of the impact of effective social distancing during 1918 influenza pandemic (18) . Thus, the reduction in growth rate may reflect the impact of vigorous control measures implemented and individual behavior changes in China during the course of the outbreak."
33772,"The Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is Highly Contagious and More Infectious Than Initially Estimated","The 2019-nCoV epidemic is still rapidly growing and spread to more than 20 countries as of February 5, 2020.

Among many factors, the Lunar New Year Travel rush in early and mid-January 2020 may or may not play a role in the high outbreak growth rate, although SARS epidemic also overlapped with the Lunar New Year Travel rush. How contiguous the 2019-nCoV is in other countries remains to be seen. If the value of R0 is as high in other countries, our results suggest that active and strong population-wide social distancing efforts, such as closing down transportation system, schools, discouraging travel, etc., might be needed to reduce the overall contacts to contain the spread of the virus. , between hospitalization to discharge (E) and between hospitalization to death (F).

33822,Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2,"Similar to outbreaks of other respiratory pathogens (1) (2) (3) (4) , syndromic airport screening at arrival of travellers from regions with a high risk of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to prevent a sufficient proportion of infected travellers to prevent global spread (5, 6) . Sensitising arriving travellers to the symptoms and risk of SARS-CoV-2 and to encourage selfisolation as well as rapidly seeking for medical assistance via telephone which in turn will trigger tracing and quarantine of contacts, may have a more pronounced effect and is currently implemented in many transport hubs. However, with increasing numbers of infected travellers contact tracing is unlikely to be sustainable for long because of the immensely resourceintensive nature of contact tracing and hence is similarly unlikely to prevent local transmission in the long term (7) ."
33822,Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2,"We represent traveller sensitisation as reducing . Sensitisation occurs via, e.g., posters and handouts to travellers arriving from high risk regions, which increases the likelihood that those travellers, if they experience SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, will self-isolate on the occurrence of mild symptoms and rapidly report to health care providers who in turn trigger contact tracing. As a base case, in line with Hellewell et al (7) we assume that these measures to accelerate self-isolation and reporting in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can reduce the average number of onward transmitting secondary infections by about 50%."

33822,Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2,"is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . travellers arrive undetected. We investigate here how syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation, as well as their combination, may delay an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. We find that while there is only about 1 infected traveller per week, syndromic airport screening can only slightly delay an outbreak (9 days (75%: 4 days, 97.5%: less than 1 day) while traveller sensitisation can have a more pronounced effect be delaying the outbreak by 29 days (75%: 12 days, 97.5%: 3 days). The combination of syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation may more substantially delay an outbreak while the number of infected travellers is low (83 days, 75%: 36 days, 97.5% 8 days). The incremental effect of syndromic entry screening is only notable if exit screening is poor. Once the weekly number of infected passengers increases to 10 and above, even with the combination of syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation delays of more than a week are unlikely. These results are sensitive to a number of key assumptions: with increasing R 0 , less heterogeneous R 0 or less effect of traveller sensitisation the estimated achievable delay quickly becomes negligible We find a potential role for interventions targeting air-passengers to delay major outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in previously unaffected regions as long as implemented when there are only a few infected travellers per week. We find that syndromic screening on arrival can add to the effect of traveller sensitisation in these early stages of a pandemic. Syndromic screening can also aid to reduce the number of passengers that would eventually self-report and then require resource-intensive follow up, including contact tracing. Therefore, syndromic screening may have an additional role in helping to sustain control efforts for longer. Of note, however, is that syndromic screening at arrival only substantially adds to control efforts if syndromic screening at departure is absent or largely ineffective."
33822,Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2,"While our findings may encourage implementation of both syndromic screening on entry and traveller sensitisation in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is important to note that these findings are highly sensitive to the underlying base-case assumptions and do not consider the economic implications of large scale air passenger screening and contact tracing. With increasing numbers of infected travellers, a higher number of secondary infections or a lower heterogeneity thereof, or less effective interventions, the achievable delay quickly drops down to a few days of delay. While all of our assumptions include the best knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 to date, there is considerable uncertainty associated with all of these assumptions. For example, we have assumed recently reported heterogeneity in the individual R 0 , however, the reported range of uncertainty includes SARS-like and influenza-like which can drastically alter the results. Some recent, yet not peer-reviewed estimates would suggest more SARS-like or even more overdispersed k which would imply that longer outbreak delays are possible as shown in our sensitivity analysis (14) . We also don't explicitly account for potential asymptomatic transmission. However, we implicitly do so as both the syndromic screening as well as the contact tracing work that informed our estimates accounted for a small proportion of asymptomatic transmitters who we assume similarly transmit but will not be affected by syndromic screening or sensitisation. Notably, we assumed a constant rate of infected travellers. However, this may increase rapidly as the epidemic continues to spread exponentially in China and potentially elsewhere. There is currently little evidence for an exponential increase in infected travellers to Europe as airports in the highest risk regions in China have shut. If .

33822,Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2,"Despite limited evidence that supports its effectiveness (16) , the US has recently banned entry to the US by most foreigners who have recently visited China (17) . In our work, we did not investigate such a drastic interruption of air travel. While a travel ban for entry with history of travel to all high-risk regions would indeed likely further limit the number of infected travellers entering to those who enter by different means, it would also come with substantial economical implications. It does also run the risk that travellers arriving in the US despite their travel history would likely not be reached by targeted sensitisation and/or that they would avoid self-reporting if symptomatic, with potentially dire implications for local spread."
33822,Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2,"In summary, we find that targeting air-travellers with syndromic screening at exit or entry and sensitisation for signs of symptoms following their arrival may delay a major outbreak in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. In most countries, air-traveller sensitisation and rapid contact tracing protocols are already in place in response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We find that syndromic screening at arrival may further enhance such control efforts while the number of infected passengers is less than about 10 per week, but only in the absence of syndromic screening at departure."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Kingdom highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. Using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current UK definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95 th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate that any definition where close contact requires more than 4 hours of contact is likely to lead to uncontrolled spread."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Contact tracing is the main public health response to importations of rare or emerging infectious diseases, and was implemented in the UK during the 'containment stage' of the 2009 influenza pandemic (McLean et al 2010) . In more recent years, contact tracing was also a valuable tool following importation of Ebola virus disease into the UK in 2014 (Crook et al 2017) and the cases of monkeypox in the UK in 2018 (Vaughan et al 2018). In general, contact tracing is a highly effective and robust strategy given sufficient resources. The main advantages are that it can identify potentially infected individuals before severe symptoms emerge, and if conducted sufficiently quickly can prevent onward transmission from the secondary cases. Contact tracing has proved hugely successful in the treatment of sexually transmitted infections, where the definition of a contact is relatively straightforward, where infection is often asymptomatic and where the time-scales of transmission are slow (Hogben et al 2016 , Rönn et al 2017 . In contrast, the use of contact tracing for novel invading pathogens has received less quantitative consideration, in part due to greater uncertainties over social contact structure (although see Ahmed et al 2018 , Hoang et al 2019 ."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Modelling studies have often focused on quantifying the importance of pre-symptomatic and pretracing infectiousness, but are usually based on statistical distributions of contact networks (Fraser et al 2004 , Kwok et al 2019 . Here we leverage detailed social network data from the UK to model both transmission and the act of tracing, and identify the implications of contact tracing for containment of a novel pathogen, using parameters for the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (Read et al 2020 , Li et al 2020 ."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"We characterised contact patterns in the UK using a postal and online cross-sectional survey, which asked participants to report the number of social encounters with unique individuals during a given day, as well as the duration and typical frequency of those encounters (Danon et al 2012 (Danon et al , 2013 . In total, 5,802 respondents reported more than 50,000 encounters -one of the biggest studies of its kind to date. The encounter patterns of this study were in good qualitative agreement with other similar studies of social interactions (Mossong et al 2008 , Isella et al 2010 . In this study, the daily encounter data was first extrapolated to generate a pattern of contacts over a 14 day period (replicating random encounters and increasing the total duration associated regular contacts), to act as the basis for transmission and contact tracing simulations. Using this extrapolated data, we can classify interactions into those which satisfy the definition of a close contact for the purpose of contact tracing. From our social encounter data we can also distinguish interactions with people who could be later identified and traced, from those with unidentifiable strangers (schematic figure 1). We assume that all contact of longer than 1 hour or repeated contacts can be identified and traced, whereas shorter meetings with people for the first time are strangers who are unidentifiable. The second element of the simulation is to determine who gets infected from a source case chosen representatively from the survey respondents. This transmission process is stochastic, accounting for both the time spent with each contact and the infectivity on each day (see Appendix). Taken together these two predictions allow us to bound the efficacy of contact tracing."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"One of the most notable features of human social contacts is the huge variability in the number and strength of contacts -which is reflected as variation in both the number of secondary cases and the number of individuals that match the contact-tracing definition (figure 2). Using preliminary estimates of COVID-19 transmission (average latent period 4 days, average effective infectious period 1.61 days, R 0 =3.11 and assuming a simple SEIR formulation (Read et al 2020)) we compute the distribution of epidemiological, social and contact tracing characteristics across the population. Extrapolating the data from the social contact survey suggests that the average number of contacts over a 14 day period is 217, although the distribution is significantly over dispersed (with a median of 90 and around 3% of individuals having >1,000 total contacts). Of these total encounters, an average of 59 contacts (27%) meet the definition of a close-contact (in contact for >15 minutes, PHE 2020) and of these close-contacts we predict an average of 36 (61%) to be individuals known to the infected case that can be traced. Therefore, simply considering social contacts, it is clear that there are very many short duration contacts which do not meet the definition of a close contact, and although unlikely to become infected may pose a risk due to their greater abundance."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Given that the risk of infection increases with duration of contact, the distribution of cases effectively represents a biased sample of all contacts. As expected, given the model assumptions, the expected number of total secondary cases agrees with the assumed R 0 (mean=3.11, median=2, and 95th percentiles 0-10). Given that these cases are most likely to be those contacts of the longest duration, we predict that 95% of cases match the definition of a close contact. However, not all of these contacts will be identifiable; assuming that all repeated contacts and contact of longer than 1 hour can be traced, we predict that 93% of all cases meet the definition and can be identified. However, because of the extreme heterogeneity in contacts between individuals and the stochastic nature of transmission, we would still expect 15% of all primary cases to generate at least one secondary case that cannot be identified. Aggregating across all individuals and under the optimistic assumption that all the contact tracing can be performed rapidly, we expect contact tracing to reduce the basic reproductive ratio from 3.11 to 0.21 -enabling the outbreak to be contained (figure 2)."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Rapid and effective contact tracing can therefore be highly effective in the early control of COVID-19, but places substantial demands on the local public-health authorities. Each new case requires an average of 36 individuals to be traced, with 8.7% of cases having more than 100 close traceable contacts (figure 2). We therefore consider the implications of changing the definition of a close contact. Clearly a more strict definition of a close contact (requiring more contact time) reduces the burden on the health services as fewer contacts need to be traced, but also increases the risk of cases being missed. Figure 3 provides a quantitative assessment of changes to the close contact definition. Definitions requiring more than four hours of contact, are unlikely to control an outbreak as the expected number of untraced secondly cases is greater than one. This therefore places a strict bound on level of contact tracing required. The added benefit from definitions shorter than 1 hour has relatively little impact on the mean number of untraced cases (figure 3b), but does reduce the probability that some untraced contacts occur."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Throughout we have used a value of R 0 that represents a population-level average once the local infection has become established. However, the first invasion into any new population or social setting generally has a larger expected number of secondary cases. The first invader enters a completely susceptible population; moreover all their close contacts (eg family members) are susceptible. In contrast, due to clustering of contacts, most secondary cases will be in a landscape with a depleted number of susceptibles -as close contacts such as family members will already have been exposed to the primary case. This susceptible depletion in the local social network may help to explain the change in R t over time reported for COVID-19 (Yang et al 2020). We therefore consider the impact of different values of the initial reproductive ratio (figure 4), which could capture this social aspect, or could represent heterogeneity between individuals in the amount of virus shed, or could inform about innate differences in behaviour between China and the UK. Given the strong biasing of transmission towards long-duration contacts, the impact of varying initial reproductive ratio is less extreme than might be expected; it is only for the highest values of initial reproductive ratio simulated (>9.8) that contact tracing fails to find more than one case such that infection can escape."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Mathematical models have an important role to play in preparedness for novel infectious diseases, allowing policy makers to plan for potential public health scenarios before they arise. However, in such scenarios reliable data is often limited, so predictions of long term dynamics are generally associated with wide confidence intervals. In contrast, while short term predictions are subject to greater stochasticity, the distribution of possible behaviours can be readily captured. Here we have investigated contact tracing of a close-contact pathogen, using 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as the example, and considered the efficacy of contact tracing as a control measure. This work brings together a detailed survey of social encounters together with bespoke mathematical modelling of the transmission and tracing processes. Given the huge heterogeneties present in social encounters (both in terms of duration and number) mathematical models are vital to interpret the interplay between a low number of high risk encounters (e.g., household members) and the high number of low-risk less-identifiable encounters (e.g., commuters or retail customers)."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"The UK currently defines a close contact as 15 minutes within 2 meters over two weeks before detection (PHE 2020) . Under this definition, there are unlikely to be many untraced secondary cases, although the burden of tracing could be large. Relaxing the definition of a contact (such that longer contact durations are needed) lessens this burden but at the greater risk of undetected cases ( Figure  3) . Surprisingly, small changes to the reproductive ratio, within the bounds estimated from early data ( Figure 4) or even changes to the distribution of infectivity, are predicted to have a relatively modest impact of the success of contact tracing illustrating the robustness of this control measure."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Our model has addressed the simple and optimistic question of whether contact tracing is sufficient to identify secondary infections. The public health implications of this tracing are more complex, and depend on the relative timing of events and the treatment of identified contacts. For contact tracing to be an effective public health measure requires secondary cases to be discovered before they become infectious; hence the time from the primary case becoming infectious to the tracing of their contacts needs to be shorter than the incubation period. Longer time scales would allow tertiary cases to be infected and would snowball the tracing process. In addition, those contacts that are traced either need to be effectively screened for infection and quarantined or otherwise isolated so that they do not pose a risk to others. Therefore, while contact tracing has the potential to control COVID-19 (and other close-contact pathogens) the ultimate success relies on the speed and efficacy with which suspect contacts can be contained."

33987,Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation,"Since January 23 rd 2020, the Chinese authorities have been implementing unprecedented and increasingly stringent public health interventions, including a complete lock-down of Wuhan and neighboring cities, strict contact tracing and travel restrictions in the epicenter and across the country [13] . Incorporating these interventions into the classical epidemic models has resulted in reliable estimates of epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 transmission in the epicenter and accurate near-casting the epidemic trend and peak time [18] [19] [20] , in comparison with other earlier modeling studies focusing on analyzing the transmission risk based on data at the early outbreak stage [1, 3, 4, 17] . One important lesson gained from our recent experience suggests the need of updating the model parameters and model setting to reflect the rapid improvement of screening, diagnosing and testing techniques/procedures, accompanied by intensive contact tracing, quarantine and isolation."
33987,Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation,"The feasibility of enhancing model capacity to assess transmission risk and evaluating intervention effectiveness has also been substantially increased due to the improvement of the quality of the data, specially from other Chinese cities and provinces where the complete lock-down of major cities such as Wuhan in the Hubei province has prevented a significant portion of infection importation, so the reduction of imported cases coupled with intensive contact tracing produced some high quality data with rather complete information on symptom onset time and transmission-chain, as will be discussed in the data section below. This enhanced model capacity for near-casting is particularly important, since the gradually relaxing of the travel restriction demands proactive-and real-time assessment of the risk of a potential second outbreak in other Chinese cities. An objective of our study is to provide this assessment, and to use this assessment along with the incorporation of feasible public health interventions into our stochastic disease transmission model to suggest the scale of interventions for these cities to prevent a second outbreak. As COVID-19 spread has occurred in many regions globally, we believe our study provides an important tool to inform public health decisions regarding travel restriction and social distancing in these regions according to their public health capacity to maintain an effective contact tracing, quarantine and isolation procedure."

The flow diagram is shown in Figure 3 . Note that here the model framework extends the model structure in our previous study by including the quarantined suspected compartment [18] [19] [20] , which consists of exposed infectious individuals resulting from contact tracing and individuals with influenza like illness and common fever needing clinical medication. The deterministic model is replaced by a discrete system with stochastic importation since the case numbers are relatively small with most of the early cases being imported in Shaanxi province [10, 12] . This modelling approach can well describe demographic stochasticity. The "

33987,Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation,"From our study, we can conclude that it is very important to study the epidemic situation of COVID-19 by using data from contact tracing rather than simply using the number of confirmed cases, especially in the areas where the imported cases are the main source of infection. This can not only provide important data information for the accurate evaluation of the epidemic situation in other areas outside Hubei Province, but also provide important and accurate data supporting the evaluation of the effectiveness and timeliness of public health intervention strategies in different areas."
33987,Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation,"In the present investigation, we devised a stochastic model that can be used as an important model framework and methodology for the evaluation of imported cases on local epidemic in the Shaanxi province or other similar provinces. From the data analysis, it seems that the stringent public health interventions adopted by the Chinese authorities are effective in controlling the infection. According to data from contact tracing, the first imported cases in the Shaanxi Province occurred earlier than January 10 th 2020, and most of the imported cases were imported to the Shaanxi Province before the implementation of the national travel restrictions on January 23 rd 2020. Therefore, the earlier the implementation of the travel restrictions, the greater the reduction of infected cases by COVID-19 in the Shaanxi province has. An intermittent population inflow with low proportion of imported cases may significantly mitigate the transmission risk. Thus, if the public health authorities can strictly monitor and reduce the number of imported cases, it would be possible for the Shaanxi province to return back and resume working continuously."

34010,Transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data,"In summary, we estimated the distribution of the generation time, incubation period, and the periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis for patients in Chinese provinces excluding Hubei. The current recommendation of 14-day quarantine period may be too short, resulting in a 6.7% failure rate. We recommend to increase the quarantine period to 22 days. The periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis changed significantly for patients who showed symptom before and after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, mostly likely driven by behavior change of the general public, and more effective public health control measures after January 23. On average, patients may become infectious 3.9 days before the onset of major symptoms. This, and the 6.6 days delay from symptom onset to diagnosis, severely hinders the effectiveness of contact tracing and quarantine, as evidenced by the 2.5% success rate of quarantine before symptom onset. The basic reproduction number is 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation. However, the majority of patients infects no more than one individual, .

The detection rate is assumed to be q 2 I(t). Infected individuals in Q class can be confirmed at the rate of ηQ(t) by nucleic acid testing. Additionally, close contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation is a critical control measure. We assume that, once a case is confirmed, q 3 individuals would be traced. Therefore, q 3 (q 2 I(t) + ηQ(t)) individuals would be traced in a unit time, which is dependent on the number of new confirmed cases q 2 I(t) + ηQ(t). We also assume that, among these traced individuals, S N fraction parts are susceptible, E N fraction parts are exposed, I N fraction parts are infectious with symptoms and A N fraction parts are infectious but asymptomatic. R N fraction parts are recovered, which are not needed to be isolated and are still in the R class."

Particularly, we adopted two novel function forms which dynamically captured the real-time endemic situation. The first one is the contact rate, c(t), which was assumed to be dependent on the cumulative number of confirmed cases to better quantify the varied interventions and self-protection measures. The other one is the contact tracing rate, which was dependent on the number of new cases. We evaluated the impact of partial lifting control measures on COVID-19 transmission. Our results show that relieve self-protection too early may lead to the spread of the virus for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even lead to the mass transmission of the virus again. The reduction of the emergency response level does not mean that people can be off guard. At least until the end of March, life will not be able to return to normal."

34143,Estimating the generation interval for COVID-19 based on symptom onset data,"Infection control for the COVID-19 epidemic relies on case-based measures such as finding cases and tracing contacts. A variable that determines how effective these case-based measures are is the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission. Our estimates of this proportion are high, ranging from 0.48 to 0.77. This implies that the effectiveness of case finding and contact tracing in preventing COVID-19 infections will be considerably smaller compared to the effectiveness in preventing SARS or MERS infections, where presymptomatic transmission did not play an important role (see e.g. [15] ). It is unlikely that these measures alone will suffice to control the COVID-19 epidemic. Additional measures, such as social distancing, are required. "

Evidence to date suggests that a substantial portion of transmission may occur before the onset of symptoms and before cases can be isolated. This has potentially important implications for the prospect of containment by isolation and contact tracing, which had previously been successful in the control of SARS."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"Using a stochastic transmission model armed with current best estimates of epidemiological parameters, we evaluated under which conditions containment would be possible for various delays in diagnosis, isolation, and contact tracing. In addition, if containment is not possible, as seems likely in many settings, we estimated the impact of isolation and contact tracing on the epidemic growth rate and the doubling time for the number of infections. Our results indicated that substantial reductions in the epidemic growth rate (from more than 0.1 per day to well under 0.1 per day) and epidemic doubling time (from approximately 6 days to perhaps more than 14 days) are feasible if the diagnosis delay is short (<3 days) and a high proportion of non-household contacts are traced and isolated (>70%)."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"Even with containment out of reach, our analyses based on best understanding of the epidemiology of COVID-19, highlight that isolation and contact tracing can be valuable by delaying and lowering the epidemic peak, thus reducing stress on healthcare systems."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"As of early March 2020, the number of infections of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is still increasing at an almost exponential rate, while the virus is rapidly expanding its range in all parts of the world. There are no registered effective medicines, treatment options are mainly supportive, and there are no vaccines available, limiting preventive measures mainly to isolation of infected persons and those that have high likelihood of being infected, for instance because they have been traced as contacts of infected persons. 1 To what extent local containment or local slowing down of an early epidemic is successful depends on the effectiveness of case isolation and contact tracing. It is known that a high probability of asymptomatic infection, a high proportion of transmission occurring before the onset of symptoms, a long delay between case finding and isolation, and high overall transmissibility all factor in negatively in the likelihood that an outbreak can be contained. [2] [3] [4] [5] For SARS-CoV-2, evidence indicates that a high fraction of infected persons is infectious before they show symptoms (up to 50%), that a substantial fraction of infections may be asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms, and that the epidemic doubling time in the absence of interventions is approximately one week. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Here we provide model-based analyses of the impact of isolation and contact tracing, using varying levels of the effectiveness of contact tracing and varying delays in diagnosis, isolation, and contact tracing. We focus on conditions that make containment of an early epidemic possible, but also on the impact of isolation and contact tracing when containment is not possible. In the latter case we report the (exponential) rate of increase and the doubling time of the epidemic for scenarios without and with interventions. Considering that the capacity of healthcare systems is limited, it is important to assess which interventions are most effective in slowing down the rate of increase of healthcare demand during an ongoing outbreak. As it is likely that isolation and contact tracing will be more effective in close contact settings with well-defined contacts (household, workplace) than in the community (commuting, public spaces), while the potential impact of household interventions on the epidemic could be smaller, we stratify the analyses by transmission settings (henceforth called household and non-household). 4 As many of the relevant epidemiological and intervention parameters are still quite uncertain, or may be variable in different settings, we focus throughout on a systematic analysis of the relation between key parameters for timeliness and completeness of contact tracing and main outcomes such as effective reproduction number and epidemic growth rate."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"We use a best case scenario, where all parameters are set to very optimistic values. We assume that all cases develop symptoms at some point during their infectious period, and will then immediately be diagnosed and isolated. Isolation will stop onward transmission completely. With respect to contact tracing, we assume that all contacts will be traced and if found infected will be isolated immediately. We assume that it takes 1 day to find and isolate both household and non-household contacts. The rationale for using these overly optimistic assumptions as a baseline is that we want to investigate for various control parameters at which point of diverging from the baseline parameters control of the outbreak will be lost. To contrast the analysis of the baseline scenario, we also considered an alternative scenario, where we used more pessimistic parameter settings. For the alternative, we assumed that 80% of cases will be diagnosed and isolated, but that there is a .

34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"We are interested in the critical tracing coverage, i.e. what proportion of non-household contacts needs to be found and isolated to control the outbreak, and in the epidemic growth rate (or epidemic doubling time) without and with contact tracing and isolation. We study how these quantities depend on the delay to diagnosis of cases and on the delay in contact tracing. We assume that household contacts can be traced with a high coverage and without delay, but that tracing of non-household contact may take longer and be less complete."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"We are interested in how controllability of the outbreak depends on the fraction of infections that develop symptoms. In our baseline scenario we assume that all infected persons develop symptoms, and we then vary this percentage between 0% and 100%. Although simulations of outbreaks can be run with the model, we focus here on general results with regard to the dependence on R0, Re, and the exponential growth rate. Finally, we consider an alternative scenario, where we assume that contact tracing is not perfect."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"If there is a diagnosis delay, the question arises how successful contact tracing has to be to keep the outbreak under control. We therefore computed the minimum fraction of nonhousehold contacts that need to be traced and isolated (henceforth termed ""critical tracing coverage"") to bring Re to below 1. The results are shown in Figures 3a and 3b . For a diagnosis delay up to 4 days, there is a chance of controlling the outbreak if the coverage of tracing non-household contacts is above the critical fraction (Figure 3a ). In Figure 3b , we varied the time it takes to trace non-household contacts between 1 and 7 days, assuming no diagnosis delay. In this case, the time needed to trace contacts does not have a large impact on the critical tracing coverage. This is because diagnosis is quick enough, such that despite a delay in tracing infected contacts, they are found before they become infectious, or if they are not found by contact tracing, they get rapidly diagnosed themselves."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"If we look at these same plots for situations where not all infected cases are diagnosed, the possibility of controlling the outbreak quickly fades. Not being diagnosed can be a consequence of not developing symptoms, having only mild symptoms, or any other reason why infected persons might not be identified by health care. We subsume these possible reasons for cases not being ascertained under the term ""asymptomatic"". In Figure 3b critical tracing coverages are shown for a situation of 80% symptomatic cases, and in Figure 3c for 60% symptomatic cases. In the latter case, control of the outbreak is not possible, even if all other parameters are set at the most optimistic values. This is also shown in Figure 4 , where we plotted the critical tracing coverage for several values of R0 as a function of the fraction of symptomatic cases (i.e. the fraction of those who will eventually develop symptoms during their entire infectious period). The figure shows that for R0 = 2.5 control is not possible with isolation and contact tracing, if less than 60% of all infected persons develop symptoms or are otherwise not detected by the health care system, even if all other parameters are at the most optimistic values. Other interventions measures are then needed for containment of the outbreak."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"In situations, where control of the outbreak is not possible with isolation and contact tracing only, it might still be possible to slow down the epidemic by those measures and thereby gain time for the health care system to deal with the outbreak. We find that contact tracing has an impact on the epidemic growth rate for diagnosis delays less than 3 days (Figure 5a ) and high coverages of tracing non-household contacts (Figure 5c ). Figures 5b and 5d show doubling times of the epidemic for situations where the fraction of symptomatic cases is 60% or lower. For very successful contact tracing interventions (i.e. small diagnosis delays and high tracing coverages) the doubling time can be increased to 30 days if 60% are symptomatic. Below that value there is little impact on the doubling time."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"In the above we considered the impact of diverging from an optimistic baseline scenario one parameter at a time. In reality, many parameters will be imperfect and their impact on the success of contact tracing will add up. As an illustration, we considered a more pessimistic scenario, where it takes 7 days to find and isolate infected non-household contacts, the coverage of tracing is 50%, the delay in diagnosis is 5 days, and only 80% of cases develop symptoms. For this scenario, the effective reproduction number is 1.4, the exponential growth rate is 0.05, and the doubling time is 14.4 days. So while containment is not possible in this scenario, the doubling time can be increased by a factor of 2.6, which implies a substantial slowing down of epidemic spread."

Especially delays in diagnosis and isolation, and the existence of asymptomatic and mild infections that contribute to onward transmission could easily make an outbreak uncontrollable (Figure 3 ). For instance, if in our default scenario the delay between onset of infectiousness and isolation is more than 4 to 6 days, the outbreak cannot be controlled even with perfect tracing. Likewise, if the fraction of asymptomatic cases is more than 40%, containment is not possible with contact tracing."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"Even though it is unlikely that early SARS-CoV-2 epidemics can be contained by a mix of contact tracing and rapid isolation alone, this does not render contact tracing useless. In fact, healthcare systems throughout the world generally are ill-prepared for sudden spikes in healthcare demand, especially in intensive care units, where laws of economics dictate that costly surplus capacity is kept to a minimum. 16 Our analyses showed that isolation and contact tracing can contribute to reducing the growth rate and doubling time of epidemics, thereby buying time, spreading the number of severe cases out over a longer period of time, and potentially also reducing the total number of infections (the ""final size""). 17 This will lower peak healthcare demand, alleviate the stress on healthcare systems, and contribute to reducing the burden of disease."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"Our analyses add to an earlier study by a more systematic analysis of the relation between key parameters (transmissibility, fraction asymptomatic, fraction of contacts traced, diagnosis delays), and by incorporating household versus non-household contacts. 18 Household contacts are at a higher risk of becoming infected than non-household contacts as persons in a household will usually have repeated contacts. On the other hand, our analyses show that household infections contribute less to onward transmission than non-household infections simply because the numbers of household contacts are much lower than numbers of other contacts. As a consequence, the effectiveness in isolating nonhousehold contacts is key for a successful contact tracing strategy."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"Another limitation that deserves scrutiny is that we have assumed that epidemiological parameters remain constant throughout the epidemic. This is unlikely to be the case, and it is to be expected that there will be behavioral changes and consideration of interventions such as school closure and limiting of mass gatherings. Such measures have proven effective earlier during the 2009 influenza pandemic [20] [21] [22] , and are increasingly being considered for COVID-19 as well. 23 If implemented, transmissibility of the virus at the population level will be reduced, and this could help to increase the effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing."
34220,Effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing for containment and slowing down a COVID-19 epidemic: a modelling study,"In conclusion, our results show that isolation and contact tracing are not expected to be able to fully control outbreaks of COVID-19, but are still important ingredients of effective containment strategies, as they are expected to reduce growth rates and increase epidemic doubling times. This is especially true when combined with transmission-reducing behavioral changes and interventions such as school closures and reducing community events."

34221,Inferring the number of COVID-19 cases from recently reported deaths,"Contact tracing has been shown to be an efficient control measure when imported cases can be detected early on (14), in addition to permitting the estimation of key epidemiological parameters (11) .

Although the overall results for the IIFA test may be more sensitive, 101 the IIFA IgM test in the COVID-19 patients was found to be less useful in the detection of acute 102 phase of the illness which is consistent with the findings of a study in SARS-CoV patients where 103 they found a less frequent (43%) and robust (less discriminatory) IgM response. 13 However, this 104 cannot be generalized as different assays will have different performances depending on the type 105 of antigen utilized. In most countries, real-time RT-PCR remains the diagnostic tool of choice in 106 the acute phase of infection given that antibody will take time to develop after the onset of 107 illness. These serological tests would be more useful in those who did not present early to a 108 healthcare facility to look for evidence of previous exposure to this virus.

34385,SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses in COVID-19 patients,"Validated serologic assays are crucial for patient contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir hosts and for epidemiological studies. Epidemiological studies are urgently needed to help uncover the burden of disease, in particular, the rate of asymptomatic infections, and to get better estimates on morbidity and mortality. Additionally, these epidemiological studies can help reveal the extent of virus spread in households, communities and specific settings; which could help guide control measures Serological assays are also needed for evaluation of the results of vaccine trials and development of therapeutic antibodies. Among the four coronavirus structural proteins, the spike (S) and the nucleocapsid (N) are the main immunogens (5) . Here, we describe development of serological assays for the detection of virus neutralizing antibodies and antibodies to the nucleocapsid (N) protein and various spike (S) domains including the S1 subunit, and receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in ELISA format. Using a wellcharacterized cohort of serum samples from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and patients PCR-confirmed to be infected with seasonal coronaviruses and other respiratory pathogens, we validated and tested various antigens in different platforms developed in-house as well as a commercial platform."
34385,SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses in COVID-19 patients,"Validated SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are currently lacking, yet urgently needed for contact tracing, epidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies. Since the N and the S proteins are the main immunogenic CoV proteins, we developed ELISA-based assays, which were able to detect antibodies to these two proteins along with the two spike domains, S1 A and RBD. Those correlated strongly with virus neutralizing antibodies detected by a PRNT50 assay. Since the majority of the human population has antibodies against the four endemic human coronaviruses, it was crucial to verify the specificity of these assays to avoid false positive results. Additionally, the two zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are also beta-coronaviruses, raising potential for cross-reactivity. Among the spike protein antigens tested, the S1 was more specific than S in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as MERS-CoV-S cross-reactive antibodies were detected in the serum of one of the COVID-19 patients which was not seen when MERS-CoV S1 was used for testing. This could be explained by the high degree of conservation in the CoV S2 subunit relative to the S1 ( Table 2) .

34708,Mobility traces and spreading of COVID-19,"What was not investigated in detail in our simulations was contact tracing, i.e. tracking down the infection chains and moving all people along infection chains into quarantine. The case of Singapore has so far shown that this may be successful. Preliminary simulation of that tactic shows that it is difficult to implement for COVID-19, since the incubation time is rather long, people are contagious before they feel sick, or maybe never feel sufficiently sick at all. We will investigate in future work if and how contact tracing can be used together with a restrictive, but not totally locked down regime."

36073,Estimation of the Transmission Risk of the 2019-nCoV and Its Implication for Public Health Interventions,"To examine the possible impact of enhanced interventions on disease infections, we plotted the number of infected individuals (I(t)) and the predicted cumulative number of reported cases with varying quarantine rate q and contact rate c. This analysis shows that reducing the contact rate persistently decreases the peak value but may either delay or bring forward the peak, as shown in Figure 3 and Table 3 . In more detail, our analysis shows that increasing quarantine rate, q, by 10 or 20 times will bring forward the peak by 6.5 or 9 days, and lead to a reduction of the peak value in terms of the number of infected individuals by 87% or 93%. This indicates that enhancing quarantine and isolation following contact tracing and reducing the contact rate can significantly lower the peak and reduce the cumulative number of predicted reported cases (Figure 4) .

Considering the spreading of the virus (Figure 5 ), and in order to examine the impact of the travel restriction on the infection in other cities such as Beijing, we initially calculated the daily number of exposed individuals imported from Wuhan to Beijing, denoted by Ime(t).

36073,Estimation of the Transmission Risk of the 2019-nCoV and Its Implication for Public Health Interventions,"Based on the reported data, we have estimated that the number of people who were identified through contact tracing and quarantined was 5897, as of 22 January 2020. In comparison with the total population size of Wuhan, the effort of close contact tracing and quarantine was insufficient and appears to have a limited impact in terms of reducing the number of infected cases and/or slowing down the epidemic. The contour plot of R_c = 1 gives the threshold values of contact rate and quarantine rate for a city to avoid an outbreak. This high threshold rate of quarantine puts an extremely high requirement for the city's public health infrastructure and its citizens' adherence to personal protective and public health interventions, including a reduction of transmission-effective contacts, separation and restriction during the quarantine."
36073,Estimation of the Transmission Risk of the 2019-nCoV and Its Implication for Public Health Interventions,"Coronaviruses occasionally lead to major outbreaks, with documented reproduction numbers ranging from 2.0 to 4.9. Currently, a fourth large-scale outbreak is occurring and spreading out from Wuhan, Hubei province, China, to neighboring provinces and other countries. There is a dearth of epidemiological data about the emerging coronavirus, which would be of crucial importance to design and implement timely, ad hoc effective public health interventions, such as contact tracing, quarantine and travel restrictions. In this study, we adopted a deterministic model to shed light on the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus and assess the impact of public health interventions on infection. We found that the basic reproduction number could be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23), which seems consistent with the special period prior to the Spring Festival when contacts were higher than usual, and with the opinion that the virus has gone through at least three-four generations. It is worth mentioning that our model made a very good prediction of the confirmed cases from 23 to 29 January 2020, as shown in Table 4 . Particularly, the predicted confirmed cases should be 7723 as of 29 January 2020, which is very close to the real number of cases of 7711. Furthermore, according to our model, the outbreak, under the most restrictive measures, is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020), with a significant low peak value. Our investigation has major practical implications for public health decision-and policy-makers. The rather high reproduction number suggests that the outbreak may be more serious than what has been reported so far, given the particular season of increasing social contacts, warranting effective, strict public health measures aimed to mitigate the burden generated by the spreading of the new virus.

36637,Investigation of three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore: implications for surveillance and response measures,"We interviewed people with confirmed COVID-19 to obtain data for demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and activity patterns, from 14 days preceding symptom onset until isolation in hospital. We initiated contact tracing to identify close contacts (ie, people who spend a prolonged time within 2 m of a confirmed case) and other contacts who had some interactions with the case. We asked people with confirmed COVID-19 about possible contact with confirmed cases reported overseas in the 14 days before symptom onset. We used open source information from other countries (including government websites), news aggregators (eg, ProMed), and media reports to identify secondary transmissions in the respective clusters. For each cluster, we investigated the implicated setting to ascertain potential interactions. We reviewed activity maps of other confirmed cases in Singapore to identify potential epidemiological links to each cluster."
36637,Investigation of three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore: implications for surveillance and response measures,"On Feb 4, 2020, Malaysia confirmed a case of COVID-19 in an individual (B1) who had recent travel history to Singapore on Jan 16-23, 2020, for a company conference (a closed business meeting for employees from company branches globally), which was attended by at least 111 participants from 19 different countries on Jan 20-22, 2020. 17 attendees at the conference were from mainland China and at least one was from Wuhan. Subsequently, six participants at the conference who had no recent travel history to China (B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, and B7) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (figure 1 middle panels). Two affected individuals from Singapore were identified through contact tracing of participants after notification from the Malaysian International Health Regulation (IHR) focal point."
36637,Investigation of three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore: implications for surveillance and response measures,"Therefore, it is important that countries, particularly those with a high travel volume from China, enhance their surveillance system to identify local cases, not merely among people with a travel history to China because cases could be present in the community. The local cases in cluster C were identified through enhanced pneumonia surveillance of people who had no history of travel to China, whereas the initial cases in cluster A were identified because of heightened suspicion by health-care workers, leading to testing. Among the first 84 confirmed cases in Singapore, ten were detected by enhanced pneumonia surveillance and testing of patients in intensive care units, and another eight affected individuals were detected based on doctors' discretion to test patients whom they viewed with suspicion for clinical or epidemiological reasons. Such surveillance systems are, therefore, important to identify cases in the commu nity who would be missed if the focus were only on travellers, and they have enabled prompt investigation and containment measures. Furthermore, with swift response in contact tracing and quarantine of close contacts, two close contacts developed symptoms and were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 during their period of quarantine, ensuring no further onward transmission of the virus. Only two of 425 close contacts identified by contact tracing developed COVID-19 (ie, most cases identified in the clusters did not transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus to their close contacts), raising the hypothesis that a few spreading events can result in clusters of transmission, whereas for most cases, transmission ended. The ease of international travel makes containment difficult. Cluster B was identified because of sharing of case data in Malaysia through the IHR focal point, and Singapore shared information on attendees at the company conference to respective IHR focal points where participants at the conference had originated. This work led to early identification of cases globally and highlights the importance of international cooperation and sharing of information under IHR to aid in active case-finding and containment."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"Isolation of cases and contact tracing becomes less effective if infectiousness begins before the onset of symptoms. 5, 6 For example, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that began in southern China in 2003, was eventually able to be controlled through tracing contacts of suspected cases and isolating confirmed cases because the majority of transmission occurred after symptom onset. 7 These interventions also play a major role in response to outbreaks where onset of symptoms and infectiousness are concurrent-eg, Ebola virus disease, 8, 9 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), 10, 11 and many other infections. 12, 13 The effectiveness of isolation and contact-tracing methods hinges on two key epidemiological parameters: the number of secondary infections generated by each new infection and the proportion of transmission that occurs before symptom onset. 5 In addition, successful contact tracing and reducing the delay between symptom onset and isolation are crucial, because, during this time, cases remain in the community where they can infect others until isolation. 6, 14 Transmission before symptom onset could only be prevented by tracing contacts of confirmed cases and testing (and quarantining) those contacts. Cases that do not seek care, potentially because of subclinical infection, are a further challenge to control."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"If COVID-19 can be controlled by isolation and contact tracing, then public health efforts should be focused on this strategy; however, if this is not enough to control outbreaks, then additional resources might be needed for additional interventions. Several key characteristics of the transmissibility and natural history of COVID-19 are currently unknown-eg, whether transmission can occur before symptom onset. Therefore, we explored a range of epidemiological scenarios that represent potential transmission properties based on current information about COVID-19 transmission. We assessed the ability of isolation and contact tracing to control disease outbreaks in areas without widespread transmission using a mathematical model. 6, [15] [16] [17] By varying the efficacy of contact-tracing efforts, the size of the outbreak when detected, and the promptness of isolation after symptom onset, we show how viable it is for countries at risk of imported cases to use contact tracing and isolation as a containment strategy."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"We initialised the branching process with five, 20, or 40 cases to represent a newly detected outbreak of varying size. Initial symptomatic cases were then isolated after symptom onset with a delay drawn from the onset-toisolation distribution (table). Isolation was assumed to be 100% effective at preventing further transmission; therefore, in the model, failure to control the outbreak resulted from the incomplete contact tracing and the delays in isolating cases rather than the inability of isolation to prevent further transmission. Either 100% or 90% of cases became symptomatic, and all symptomatic cases were eventually reported."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"Evidence before this study Contact tracing and isolation of cases is a common intervention for controlling infectious disease outbreaks. It can be effective but might require intensive public health effort and cooperation to effectively reach and monitor all contacts. Previous work has shown that when the pathogen has infectiousness before symptom onset, control of outbreaks using contact tracing and isolation is more challenging. Further introduction of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to new territories is likely in the coming days and weeks, and interventions to prevent an outbreak following these introductions are a key mitigating strategy. Current planning is focused on tracing of contacts of introduced cases, and rapid isolation. These methods have been used previously for other novel outbreaks, but it is not clear if they will be effective for COVID-19."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"We use a mathematical model to assess the feasibility of contact tracing and case isolation to control outbreaks of COVID-19. We used disease transmission characteristics specific to the pathogen and give the best available evidence if contact tracing and isolation can achieve control of outbreaks. We simulated new outbreaks starting from 5, 20, or 40 introduced cases. Contact tracing and isolation might not contain outbreaks of COVID-19 unless very high levels of contact tracing are achieved. Even in this case, if there is subclinical transmission, or a high fraction of transmission before onset of symptoms, this strategy might not achieve control within 3 months."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"Each newly infected case was identified through contact tracing with probability ρ. Secondary cases that had been traced were isolated immediately on becoming symptomatic. Cases that were missed by contact tracing (probability 1-ρ) were isolated when they became symptomatic, with a delay drawn from the onset-toisolation distribution."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"In addition, each case had an independent probability of being subclinical, and was therefore not detected either by self-report or contact tracing. New secondary cases caused by a subclinical case were missed by contact tracing and could only be isolated on the basis of symptoms. The model included isolation of symptomatic individuals only-ie, no quarantine, so isolation could not prevent transmission before symptom onset. In the model, subclinical cases were never isolated, whereas symptomatic cases might transmit before symptoms appear, but were eventually isolated. Quarantining contacts of cases (ie, individuals who are not yet symptomatic, and might not be infected) requires a considerable investment in public health resources, and has not been widely implemented for all contacts of cases. 3 However, some countries have adopted a quarantine or self-quarantine policy for airline travellers who have returned from countries with confirmed COVID-19 transmission. 23"
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"We explored two scenarios of delay (short and long) between symptom onset and isolation (figure 2). The short delay was estimated during the late stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore, 18 and the long delay was an empirical distribution calculated from the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. 23 We varied the percentage of contacts traced from 0% to 100%, at 20% intervals, to quantify the effectiveness of contact tracing."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"After an incubation period, person A shows symptoms and is isolated at a time drawn from the delay distribution (table) . A draw from the negative binomial distribution with mean reproduction number (R 0 ) and distribution parameter determines how many people person A potentially infects. For each of those, a serial interval is drawn. Two of these exposures occur before the time person A is isolated. Each contact is traced with probability ρ, with probability 1-ρ they are missed by contact tracing. Person B is successfully traced, which means that they will be isolated without delay when they develop symptoms. They could, however, still infect others before they are isolated. Person C is missed by contact tracing. This means that they are only detected if and when symptomatic, and are isolated after a delay from symptom onset. Because person C was not traced, they infected two more people (E and F), in addition to person D, than if they had been isolated at symptom onset. A version with subclinical transmission is given in the appendix (p 12). set to the incubation period for that case, an SD of 2, and a skew parameter chosen such that a set proportion of serial intervals were shorter than the incubation period (meaning that a set proportion of transmission happened before symptom onset; figure 2 ). This sampling approach ensured that the serial interval and incubation period for each case was correlated, and prevented biologically implausible scenarios where a case could develop symptoms soon after exposure, but not become infectious until very late after exposure and vice versa."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"There are many estimates of the reproduction number for the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak The incubation distribution estimate fitted to data from the Wuhan outbreak by Backer and colleagues. 22 (C) An example of the method used to sample the serial interval for a case that has an incubation period of 5 days. Each case has an incubation period drawn from the distribution in (B), their serial interval is then drawn from a skewed normal distribution with the mean set to the incubation period of the case. In (C), the incubation period was 5 days. The skew parameter of the skewed normal distribution controls the proportion of transmission that occurs before symptom onset; the three scenarios explored are less than 1%, 15%, and 30% of transmission before onset. in Wuhan, China, 15, 17, 18, 21, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] and therefore we used the values 1·5, 2·5, and 3·5, which span most of the range of current estimates (table) . We used the secondary case distribution from the 2003 SARS outbreak, 19 and tested the effect of lower heterogeneity in the number of secondary cases 29 as a sensitivity analysis (appendix pp 2-5). We calculated the effective reproduction number (R eff ) of the simulation as the average number of secondary cases produced by each infected person in the presence of isolation and contact tracing. We present results in relation to the baseline scenario of R 0 of 2·5, 21 20 initial cases, a short delay to isolation, 20 15% of transmission before symptom onset, 30 and 0% subclinical infection. 31 Values of the natural history represent the current best understanding of COVID-19 transmission, and we used 20 index cases and a short delay to isolation to represent a relatively large influx into a setting of high awareness of possible infection. 23"
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"Outbreak control was defined as no new infections between 12 and 16 weeks after the initial cases. Outbreaks that reached 5000 cumulative cases were assumed to be too large to control within 12-16 weeks, and were categorised as uncontrolled outbreaks. Based on this definition, we reported the probability that an outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-like pathogen would be controlled within 12 weeks for each scenario, assuming that the basic reproduction number remained constant and no other interventions were implemented. The probability that an outbreak is controlled gives a one-dimensional understanding of the difficulty of achieving control, because the model placed no constraints on the number of cases and contacts that could be traced and isolated. In reality, the feasibility of contact tracing and isolation is likely to be determined both by the probability of achieving control, and the resources needed to trace and isolate infected cases. 32 We therefore reported the weekly maximum number of cases undergoing contact tracing and isolation for each scenario that resulted in outbreak control. New cases require their contacts to be traced, and if these numbers are high, it can overwhelm the contact-tracing system and affect the quality of the contact-tracing effort. 33 It is likely that the upper limit on contacts to trace varies from country to country."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"To achieve control of 90% of outbreaks, 80% of contacts needed to be traced and isolated for scenarios with a reproduction number of 2·5 ( figure 3 ). The probability of control was higher at all levels of contact tracing when the reproduction number was 1·5, and fell rapidly for a reproduction number of 3·5. At a reproduction number of 1·5, the effect of isolation was coupled with the chance of stochastic extinction resulting from overdispersion, 19 which is why some outbreaks were controlled even at 0% contacts traced. Isolation and contact tracing decreased transmission, as shown by a decrease in the effective reproduction number ( figure 3) . When the basic reproduction number was 1·5, the median estimate rapidly fell below 1, which indicated that control was probable. For the higher transmission scenarios, a higher level of contact tracing was needed to bring the median effective reproduction number below 1. The effect of isolation without contact tracing can be seen at 0%, where the effective reproduction number was lower than the simulated basic reproduction number because of rapid isolation (and ceasing transmission) of cases."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"The number of initial cases had a large effect on the probability of achieving control. With five initial cases, there was a greater than 50% chance of achieving control in 3 months, even at modest contact-tracing levels For code see https://github.com/ cmmid/ringbp (figure 4). More than 40% of these outbreaks were controlled with no contact tracing because of the combined effects of isolation of symptomatic cases and stochastic extinction. The probability of control dropped as the number of initial cases increased-eg, for 40 initial cases, 80% contact tracing did not lead to 80% of simulations controlled within 3 months. The delay from symptom onset to isolation had a major role in achieving control of outbreaks ( figure 4) . At 80% of contacts traced, the probability of achieving control fell from 89% to 31%, with a long delay from onset to isolation. If no transmission occurred before symptom onset, then the probability of achieving control was higher for all values of contacts traced ( figure 4) . The difference between 15% and 30% of transmission before symptoms had a marked effect on probability to control. We found this effect in all scenarios tested (appendix p 5). In scenarios in which only 10% of cases were asymptomatic, the probability that simulations were controlled by isolation and contact tracing for all values of contact tracing decreased ( figure 4) . For 80% of contacts traced, only 37% of outbreaks were controlled, compared with 89% without subclinical infection. These figures show the effect of changing one model assumption at a time; all combinations are given in the appendix, in comparison to the baseline scenario (appendix pp 2-5)."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"In many scenarios, between 25 and 100 symptomatic cases occurred in a week at the peak of the simulated outbreak ( figure 5 ). All of these cases, and their contacts, would need to be isolated. Large numbers of new cases can overwhelm isolation facilities, and the more contacts that need to be traced, the greater the logistical task of following them up. In the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Liberia, each case reported between six and 20 contacts, 8 and the number of contacts seen in MERS outbreaks is often higher than that. 10 20 contacts for each of 100 cases means 2000 contacts traced to achieve control. Uncontrolled outbreaks typically had higher numbers of cases (appendix p 13). The maximum numbers of weekly cases Figure 5 : The maximum weekly cases requiring contact tracing and isolation in scenarios with 20 index cases that achieved control within 3 months Scenarios vary by reproduction number and the mean delay from onset to isolation. 15% of transmission occurred before symptom onset, and 0% subclinical infection. The percentage of simulations that achieved control is shown in the boxplot. This illustrates the potential size of the eventually controlled simulated outbreaks, which would need to be managed through contact tracing and isolation. *The interval extends out of the plotting region. figure 5 might appear counterintuitive, because a lower maximum number of weekly cases is not associated with higher outbreak control. This occurs because with better contact tracing it becomes possible to control outbreaks with higher numbers of weekly cases."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"We determined conditions in which case isolation, contact tracing, and preventing transmission by contacts who are infected would be sufficient to control a new COVID-19 outbreak in the absence of other control measures. We found that in some plausible scenarios, case isolation alone would be unlikely to control transmission within 3 months. Case isolation was more effective when there was little transmission before symptom onset and when the delay from symptom onset to isolation was short. Preventing transmission by tracing and isolating a larger proportion of contacts, thereby decreasing the effective reproduction number, improved the number of scenarios in which control was likely to be achieved. However, these outbreaks required a large number of cases to be contact traced and isolated each week, which is of concern when assessing the feasibility of this strategy. Subclinical infection markedly decreased the probability of controlling outbreaks within 3 months."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"In scenarios in which the reproduction number was 2·5, 15% of transmission occurred before symptom onset, and there was a short delay to isolation, at least 80% of infected contacts needed to be traced and isolated to give a probability of control of 90% or more. This scenario echoes other suggestions that highly effective contact tracing will be necessary to control outbreaks in other countries. 16 In scenarios in which the delay from onset to isolation was long, similar to the delays in the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan, the same contact tracing success of 80% achieved a probability of containing an outbreak of less than 40%. Higher presymptomatic transmission decreases the probability that the outbreaks were controlled, under all reproduction numbers and isolation delay distributions tested."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"Our model did not include other control measures that might decrease the reproduction number and therefore also increase the probability of achieving control of an outbreak. At the same time, it assumed that isolation of cases and contacts is completely effective, and that all symptomatic cases are eventually reported. Relaxing these assumptions would decrease the probability that control is achieved. We also make the assumption that contact is required for transmission between two individuals, but transmission via fomites might be possible. This type of transmission would make effective contact tracing challenging, and good respiratory and hand hygiene would be crucial to reduce this route of transmission, coupled with environmental decontamination in health-care settings. For this reason, we used contact-tracing percentage intervals of 20% to avoid indicating more precision in the corresponding probability of control than the model could support. We simplified our model to determine the effect of contact tracing and isolation on the control of outbreaks under different scenarios of transmission; however, as more data becomes available, the model can be updated or tailored to particular public health contexts. The robustness of control measures is likely to be affected both by differences in transmission between countries, but also by the concurrent number of cases that require contact tracing in each scenario. Practically, there is likely to be an upper bound on the number of cases that can be traced, which might vary by country, and case isolation is likely to be imperfect. 34 We reported the maximum number of weekly cases during controlled outbreaks, but the capacity of response efforts might vary. In addition to the number of contacts, other factors could decrease the percentage of contacts that can be traced, such as cooperation of the community with the public health response."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"We explored a range of scenarios informed by the latest evidence on transmission of COVID-19. Similar analyses using branching models have already been used to analyse the Wuhan outbreak to find plausible ranges for the initial exposure event size and the basic reproduction number. 15, 18 Our analysis expands on this work by including infectiousness before the onset of symptoms, case isolation, explicit modelling of case incubation periods, and time to infectiousness. A key area of uncertainty is whether, and for how long, individuals are infectious before symptom onset, and whether subclinical infection occurs; both are likely to make the outbreak harder to control. 22 Whether, and how much, transmission occurs before symptoms is difficult to quantify. Under-reporting of prodromal symptoms, such as fatigue and mild fever, is possible; thus, transmission might not truly be occurring before symptoms, but before noticeable symptoms. There is evidence of transmission before onset, 30 and so we used 15%. Increased awareness of prodromal symptoms, and therefore short delays until isolation-as seen in the SARS outbreak in Beijing in 2003 35 -would increase control of outbreaks in our model. If contact tracing included testing of non-symptomatic contacts, those contacts could be quarantined without symptoms, which would decrease transmission in the model. Costs associated with additional testing might not be possible in all contexts."
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"Our study indicates that in most plausible outbreak scenarios, case isolation and contact tracing alone is insufficient to control outbreaks, and that in some scenarios even near perfect contact tracing will still be insufficient, and further interventions would be required to achieve control. Rapid and effective contact tracing can reduce the initial number of cases, which would make the outbreak easier to control overall. Effective contact tracing and isolation could contribute to reducing the overall size of an outbreak or bringing it under control over a longer time period."

Two contacts were evaluated at low risk of infection, the taxi driver who drove the case from the airport to his home (30-min drive) and the general practitioner who took care of the patient before wearing appropriate personal protection equipment (3-min non-close contact). Seventeen contacts were evaluated at moderate/ high risk of infection. Four of them shared the same waiting room in the general practitioner's office while Case 1 was coughing, seated ca 1-1.5 m away from the case during 5-30 min. The other 13 contacts were the persons sitting in the two seats around Case 1 in the Shanghai-Paris and Paris-Bordeaux flights (Figure) . They were considered at moderate risk of exposure despite the fact that Case 1 reported wearing a mask during the whole flight; this was based on the length of one of the flights (> 6 h) and the fact that it was unclear whether or not Case 1 removed his mask during short periods (e.g. meals) and kept the same mask during the whole flights. None of the contacts of the Shanghai-Paris flight were French nationals and their contact tracing was referred to their home countries' health authorities. All other identified contacts were evaluated at negligible risk of infection because the contacts were short and/or distant in public settings and did not imply face-to-face conversations or because appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn by the healthcare personnel who took care of the patient, including those involved in the transfer from the general practitioner to the referring hospital."

To lower the risk of further disease transmission, the authority in Wuhan suspended public transport indefinitely from Jan 23, 2020; similar measures were adopted soon in many other cities in China. As of Jan 25, 2020, 30 Chinese provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions covering over 1·3 billion people have initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. A range of measures has been urgently adopted, 1,2 such as early identification and isolation of suspected and diagnosed cases, contact tracing and monitoring, collection of clinical data and biological samples from patients, dissemination of regional and national diagnostic criteria and expert treatment consensus, establishment of isolation units and hospitals, and prompt provision of medical supplies and external expert teams to Hubei province."

Furthermore, symptoms of the infection, such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, could lead to worsening anxiety and mental distress. 2019-nCoV has been repeatedly described as a killer virus, for example on WeChat, which has perpetuated the sense of danger and uncertainty among health workers and the public. In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality, were reported. 6, 7 Mandatory contact tracing and 14 days quarantine, which form part of the public health responses to the 2019-nCoV pneumonia outbreak, could increase patients' anxiety and guilt about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends."

The Chinese government has implemented a series of large-scale public health interventions to control the epidemic, many of which have far exceeded what International Health Regulations required, especially Wuhan lock-down, nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement. Wuhan had prohibited all transport in and out of the city as of 10:00 on January 23, 2020, this is maybe the largest quarantine/movement restriction in human history to prevent infectious disease spread (Tian et al, 2020) . Hundreds of millions Chinese residents, including 9 million Wuhan residents, have to reduce even stop their inter-city travel and intra-city activities due to these strict measures."

The date of presumed infection was estimated from cases' history of exposure, excluding cases with exposure to Wuhan. When multiple exposures were reported, we considered the interval between the first and last recorded dates of exposure.

One case who reported the onset of symptoms on the same day as the index case was dropped from the analysis (see Appendix, Tab. S10 and Fig. S5 for a sensitivity analysis) . Moreover, as we cannot exclude that a fraction of these secondary cases had a previous exposure to an unidentified infection source, we performed a sensitivity analysis by different levels of data censoring (see Appendix, pages 16 and 17).

35135,Backcalculating the Incidence of Infection with COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess,"where is the cumulative incidence on day t, Z is the cumulative incidence at the end of the outbreak, s is the parameter that governs the flexibility of the logistic curve, a is the early growth rate of cases and ti is the inflection point of the cumulative incidence curve. Assuming that the cumulative incidence is Gaussian distributed, four unknown parameters were estimated. The Richards model was fitted to two different datasets, i.e., (i) the dataset of the entire course of the epidemic and (ii) the dataset by 4 February 2020. The latter dataset corresponds to the time period without any impact of movement restriction that was in place from 5 February onwards. Figure 1 shows the epidemic curve by contact history and type of membership. The highest incidence of illness onset was observed on 7 February. The epidemic curve in a latter half period was dominated by crew members whose movement was not strictly controlled due to the need to continue service on the ship. The second dominating group was passengers with close contact history. The last illness onset date on board of a passenger without close contact was on 14 February. Estimating the incidence of infection, the peak incidence was identified for the period from 2 to 4 February among passengers both with and without close contact (Figure 2 ). The incidence of infection abruptly dropped after 5 February, the date of movement restriction. Among passengers without close contact, the incidence was estimated to be zero, except for 8-10 February 2020, during which 0.98 persons (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0, 7.74) per day were estimated to have been infected. The epidemic peak among crew members was seen for the period from 8 to 10 February 2020. Figure 3 compares the cumulative incidence with and without movement restriction policy from 5 February. In the presence of intervention, the cumulative incidence among passengers with and without close contact and crew members were 102, 47 and 48 cases, respectively, as of 24 February 2020. These were well realized by the Richards model. Without intervention from 5 February onwards, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively. "
35135,Backcalculating the Incidence of Infection with COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess,"A large outbreak of COVID-19 occurred on a cruise ship. Estimating the incidence, the peak time of infection was shown to have been from 2 to 4 February, and the incidence abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February, on which the movement restriction policy was imposed, and at most there was, on average, one case of infection per day from 8 to 10 February. Other than continued exposure among crew members, the estimated incidence in this study indicates that the movement restriction policy from 5 February 2020 was highly successful in greatly reducing the number of secondary transmissions on board. Based on an analysis of illness onset data on board (and before the disembarkation of a large number of passengers), the risk of infection among passengers without close contact was considered to be very limited Among disembarked passengers, symptomatic cases have started to be reported on the ground in and outside of Japan. In particular, cases arising from passengers without close contact indicate a possible pathway of infection via mechanisms that were not covered by the abovementioned analysis that relied on symptomatic cases. Although the transmission via direct human-to-human contact was prevented by movement restrictions, the role of other modes of transmission, e.g., environmental and asymptomatic transmissions, should be further explored.

Confining passengers inside the ship, a misjudged containment strategy, lead to 17% of the 3,700 passengers and crew being infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The cruise ship condition enabled a highly transmissible disease to sustain an outbreak. (3,7) The significance of mass gatherings to disease transmission is directly linked to the efficiency of transmission expressed in epidemiologic terms as the basic reproduction number or R 0 .

We present a route proposal that shows how the community pharmacist may develop his responsibility to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the COVID-19. In the route have been considered three possible entrances depending on the needs of the users: anti-flu drugs, symptoms related to COVID-19 infection or the request for items for hygiene and prevention of transmission such as alcohol and face masks. Later, self-care education should be given, and the possible cases should be reported to the telephone lines designated by the mayor or the governor, continuing the healthcare process.

34481,COVID-19 in Canada: Predictions for the future and control lessons from Asia,"As with any discussion of exponential virus growth, it is difficult to predict exactly when the peak of the outbreak will take place in Canada. However our models are consistent with other models of exponential growth, including those from Italy where the exponential growth pattern continues unabated. 5 Countries in Asia, including Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, have rapidly brought the COVID-19 outbreak under control, and have important lessons to teach European and North American nations struggling with exponential growth rates. Both these nations have used a multitude of early, aggressive interventions including rapid border controls, social distancing, the innovative and population-wide use of smart phone technology and the ubiquitous wearing of surgical masks in healthcare settings as well as the general population. 10 Apart from the late and uncertain adoption of social distancing, Canada has not been willing or able to learn from these countries' experience. In particular, there is not yet any attempt to mobilize smart phone technology or use face masks for all healthcare workers.

Smart phone technology adapted to Canadian needs would involve the creation of a national-level app which can be downloaded and used to track COVID-19 cases in real time, provide uniform updates on public policy and announcements; and make simple, consistent messaging available on a national scale. The ubiquitous use of face masks, at least in healthcare settings is a rapid adoption NPI which can have major impacts on COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality in Canada and elsewhere. 11 Policymakers in Canada should also implement a rapid roll out of policies that harness the power of smart phone technology [12] [13] [14] [15] and the wearing of face masks by the public. Unfortunately, the messaging in Canada has been counterproductive and has included various versions of ""face masks don't work unless properly used."" This is the same as claiming that hand washing does not work, unless properly carried out. Both Taiwan and Hong Kong function as forms of democracies, not unlike Canada and the United States. It should therefore be possible to move with deliberate and urgent speed to implement policies that have been shown to work in these Asian countries. Mandating healthcare workers to wear a mask in work places is a good start. Failure to make bold and rapid moves based on the successful measures that have been implemented in Taiwan and Hong Kong is likely to prove very costly in terms of overloaded ICU resources, public mistrust of health officials and an exponential increase in morbidity and mortality, the latter of which were observed in countries like Italy."

As the epicentre of the outbreak, Wuhan faces the dilemma of balancing the substantial accumulating economic losses with the hard-earned control of the epidemic. Lifting the quarantine restrictions in the city and reopening transport links with the rest of China has become the top priority for the policymakers. We aim to determine to what level of the two commonly used control measures, social distancing and facial mask usage, are necessary to prevent a resurgence of the epidemic due to either residual active cases in Wuhan or imported cases after lifting the quarantine."
34577,"What is required to prevent a second major outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 upon lifting the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city, China","We examined six proposed dates for quarantine lifting in our model. When public contact recovered to 100% the pre-quarantine level and facial mask usage was high at 95%, the epidemic would follow a smooth decline to elimination regardless of which day for quarantine was lifted ( Figure 1a ). In contrast, when facial mask usage was reduced to 50%, any quarantine lifting date before 25 th April would result in a second major outbreak (Figure 1b) . Similarly, when facial mask usage was sustained at 80%, and public contact rate was recovered to 100% of the pre-quarantine level, an earlier lifting on 21 st March may lead to a second minor outbreak ( Figure 1c ). But, if the public contact rate was 50% more than the pre-quarantine level, a second major outbreak would occur in all quarantine lifting dates except 25 th April (Figure 1d )."
34577,"What is required to prevent a second major outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 upon lifting the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city, China","Combinations of high facial mask usage and reduced public contacts may lead to a smooth decline of the epidemic on various quarantine lifting dates ( Figure 2 ). For an early lifting date (21 st March), facial mask needed to be sustained at a relatively high rate (≥85%) if public contacts were to recover to 100% of the pre-quarantine level. In contrast, lifting the quarantine on 18 th April allowed public person-to-person contact adjusted back to the pre-quarantine level with a substantially lower level of facial mask usage (75%). However, a low facial mask usage (<50%) combined with an increased public contact (>100%) would always lead a significant second outbreak in most quarantine lifting scenarios. Lifting the quarantine on 25 th April would ensure a smooth decline of the epidemics regardless of the combinations of public contact rates and facial mask usage."
34577,"What is required to prevent a second major outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 upon lifting the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city, China","Metropolitan-wide quarantine that was introduced in Wuhan on 23rd January 2020 and has been remarkably effective at reducing transmission of COVID-19. We showed that it was possible to lift the quarantine and control the epidemic, but only if specific measures such as sustaining high facial mask usage and limiting the public contact rate remained in place. Otherwise, the epidemic will recur either from residual cases in Wuhan or imported cases from elsewhere when the transport links resume. Adopting and maximising other methods such as testing, contact tracing, and frequent hand washing would also reduce the probability of a second epidemic."
34577,"What is required to prevent a second major outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 upon lifting the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city, China","Our study suggests that maintaining a reduction in the contact rate below the pre-quarantine levels is an important ongoing intervention until a vaccine is available. If residents return to the same level of activities as the pre-quarantine very high level of facial mask usage rate of 85% (or other powerful interventions) will be required. Any additional public interactions, such as the influx of the five million returning residents to Wuhan, may trigger a second outbreak. Governments will need to determine how to minimise public contacts from workplaces, venues for essential daily commodities, residents, leisure, entertainment venues and public events although limiting or modifying the later may be important. Intercity travel should be minimised, and the return of the residents may need to be staged. The full restoration of the intercity public transportation may take months, and careful planning of the size of population inflow is necessary."
34577,"What is required to prevent a second major outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 upon lifting the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city, China","Maintaining ongoing high facial mask usage among the population may be challenging for a number of reasons. Firstly, supplying this number of masks to a population of the size of Wuhan let alone other cities in China and the world will be very challenging and may critically limit their availability for health care workers at high risk. Re-using disposable masks that may limit their efficacy."
34577,"What is required to prevent a second major outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 upon lifting the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city, China","China is in a unique position to determine if the quarantine measures that successfully contained COVID-19 in Wuhan can be eased while allowing economic activity to resume. We recommend population facial mask usage only when the provision for high-risk health care workers is secured. We acknowledge the substantial pragmatic issues exist in rolling out and maintaining such a program worldwide due to inadequate supply of facial masks. But notwithstanding this limitation, this information may be of use to other cities, in other parts of Asia, Europe and the US that are currently experiencing rising epidemics of COVID-19. Limiting transmission while maintaining economic activity until a vaccine is available would be the ultimate goal."

The second choice is intended to model the possible panic effect after human-to-human transmission was publicly confirmed. The third choice is impossibly extreme. We only included it to compare our results with assuming a simple exponential model for # with no offset, thereby ignoring the effect of the January 23 travel ban."

The fitted growth exponent using our working model was = 0.25 (Panel B). This is consistent with our prediction of in the last paragraph based on the decreasing infections after January 19. On the contrary, if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last three days, a similar calculation shows that the stationary point in Panel A should be around January 16. These qualitative assessments show that our working model provide superior fit to the data."
33767,Analysis of the epidemic growth of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak using internationally confirmed cases,"We further performed a thorough sensitivity analysis of our results (Table 1 and Online Supplement) using a different estimation period, the other two travel rates, and the incubation period and serial interval reported for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Donnelly et al., 2003; Lipsitch et al., 2003) . We found that our estimated epidemiological parameters are relatively insensitive to these choices unless we ignore the outbound travel ban on January 23. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to the prior chosen for the rate of travel. Not surprisingly, we found that the estimated growth exponent is not sensitive to the choice, but the total number of infections are very sensitive to the choice (Online Supplement)."
33767,Analysis of the epidemic growth of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak using internationally confirmed cases,"A third distinction with the analysis by ) is that our model takes into account the restricted outbound travel from Wuhan since January 23, 2020 ---a milestone event in this epidemic. The analysis by used a more complicated susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered (SEIR) model and only accounted for the quarantine of Wuhan in their forecast but not in their estimation. Ignoring the travel ban since January 23 could also produce much smaller growth rate in our model. However, we have convincingly demonstrated that this leads to very poor fit of the distribution of infection time."
33767,Analysis of the epidemic growth of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak using internationally confirmed cases,"Despite these potential limitations, we convincingly demonstrated that a simple theoretical model ---exponential growth with correction for the travel ban on January 23 ---provides very good fit to the internationally confirmed cases with detailed case trajectories. Our results suggest that the early outbreak of 2019-nCoV could have been spreading much faster in Wuhan than previous estimates. This has important implications in designing prevention measures to control the outbreak in other cities in China and around the world. On the more positive side, our simulated infection rates in January 21 to 23 showed visually significant departure from the previous growth pattern (Panel B, Figure 2 ). This gives some evidence that the prevention measures following the public confirmation of human-to-human transmission in the evening of January 20 were effective."
33788,The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak,"Starting in December 2019, Chinese health authorities have been closely monitoring a cluster of pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei province. It has been determined that the pathogen causing the viral pneumonia among affected individuals is a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) (1) . As of February 7th, 2020, a total of 31,213(2) cases have been detected and confirmed in Mainland China. Internationally, there are more than 200 additional cases detected and confirmed in 23 countries (3) . In this work we model both the domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV epidemic. We estimate the effects of the travel ban implemented in Wuhan and the international travel restrictions adopted by a number of countries in early February, 2020."
33788,The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak,"for R 0 , the overall evolution of the epidemic is determined by the growth rate of infectious individuals and generates results consistent with those presented here. Results under the assumptions of a different generation time (T g = 9), and the presence of mildly symptomatic individuals not detected internationally are reported in the Supplementary To analyze the effect of the travel ban within Wuhan, we implemented long-range travel restrictions beginning on January 23rd and restricted the local commuting flows on January 25th. Initially, we assume no changes in the transmissibility and disease dynamics. The model output shows no noticeable differences in the epidemic trajectory of Wuhan, while it shows a delay of about 3 days occurring for other locations in China (see Fig. 1A ). The overall reduction of cases in Mainland China excluding Wuhan is close to 20% by February 22, with a relative reduction of cases across specific locations varying in a range from 1% to 57%, (Fig. 2) . With a doubling time of approximately 5 days, this level of reduction corresponds to only a modest delay of the epidemic trajectory of 1 to 6 days. These results are in agreement with estimates resulting from the combination of epidemiological and human mobility data (21) . The model indicates clearly that as of January 23, 2020, the epidemic was seeded in several locations across Mainland China. As an independent validation test, we show in fig 1B) the cumulative number of cases in Mainland China provinces through February 5, 2020, as reported from DXY.cn, a Chinese online community network for physicians, health care professionals, pharmacies and healthcare facilities established in 2000 (22; 16) , and compare these results with model projections. The model projections are highly correlated with the observed data (Pearson's r = 0.77, P < 0.000001), although as expected we find that there are significantly fewer reported cases than projected (See Fig.  1 B) . If we assume that the observed number of cases are the result of different binomial processes that with a certain probability will determine the actual detection of a case, we find that the median ascertainment rate of detecting an infected individual in the population is equal to 19.59% [IQR: 14.36%, 35.58%] in Mainland China. In other words, our model suggests that surveillance only detects one out of five cases."
33788,The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak,"The model allows us to estimate the number of case importations in international locations from Mainland China. We analyze how this number would increase according to projections in a fully status quo scenario compared to the presence of a travel ban. In Fig. 1C ) we report the mean number of total international importation events in the two scenarios. We find an 80% reduction in cases imported from Mainland China to other countries until the end of February. While the number of cases imported internationally initially has a marked decrease, it picks up again in the following weeks with importation from other locations in China. The model indicates that after the travel restrictions in Wuhan are implemented on January 23, the top 5 ranked cities as the origin of international case importations are Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Kunming. Similarly, the model allows ranking countries across the world according to the relative risk of importing cases from Mainland China. More precisely the relative risk is defined for each country Y , as the relative probability P (Y ) that a single infected individual travels from the index areas to that specific destination Y . In other words, given the occurrence of one exported case, P (Y ) is the relative probability that the disease carrier will appear in location Y , with respect to any 3 .

This risk depends on the travel flow from cities in Mainland China to other countries and the disease prevalence in those cities. It is also worth remarking that our traffic flows are origin destination data that do not depend on traveling routes, and are a proxy for the actual mobility demand across cities. In Fig. 3 we provide a visualization of how each one of the top cities in China contribute to the relative risk of the top 20 countries at risk of importation for the dates before and after the travel ban in Wuhan was in effect. In particular, before the travel ban 84% of the internationally imported cases originated from Wuhan; while after the travel ban, the top 10 contributors to the relative risk are needed to account for at least ∼ 80% of the internationally imported cases where the top three contributors are: Shanghai (27.85%), Beijing (14.28%), and Shenzhen (13.68%). In terms of relative risk of importation, the countries at higher risk of importation after the implementation of the Wuhan travel ban are: Japan (11.01% pre-travel ban, 13.97% post-travel ban), Thailand (22.89% pre-travel ban, 12.01% post-travel ban), Republic of Korea (7.48% pre-travel ban, 11.58% post-travel ban), Taiwan (9.32% pre-travel ban, 9.88% post-travel ban), and USA (4.66% pre-travel ban, 5.91% post-travel ban)."
33788,The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak,"Even in presence of the above limitations, the analysis of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV outbreak and the modeling assessment of the effects of travel limitations could be instrumental to national and international agencies for public health response planning. We show that by January 23 2020, the epidemic had already spread to other cities within China. The travel quarantine around Wuhan has only modestly delayed the epidemic spread to other areas of China. This is in agreement with separate studies on the diffusion of the 2019-nCoV virus in China (29; 21; 30). The model indicates that while the Wuhan travel ban was initially effective at reducing international case importations, the number of cases observed outside China will resume its growth after 2-3 weeks from cases that originated elsewhere. Furthermore, the modeling study shows that additional travel limitations up to 90% of the traffic have a modest effect unless paired with public health interventions and behavioral changes that achieve a considerable reduction in the disease transmissibility (31). The above results provides data with potential uses for the definition of optimized containment schemes and mitigation policies that includes the local and international dimension of the 2019-nCoV epidemic."
34190,The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.,"In response to the epidemic of COVID-19, (1) Australia implemented a travel ban from China on February 1 st 2020, adding Iran and then South Korea to the ban on February 29 th and March 5 th respectively. In addition, Australians evacuated from Wuhan and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship were quarantined for two weeks in dedicated quarantine facilities. The ban on travel from China has been periodically reviewed, with lifting of restrictions announced on February 23 rd for high school students, who number less than 800. In contrast, over 120000 university students are unable to enter Australia to commence or resume their studies, and a booming tourism industry has ceased."
34190,The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.,"Travel bans and social distancing measures are effective public health tools to control epidemic diseases (2), and Australia successfully delayed the introduction of the 1918 pandemic by 1 year and reduced the total mortality compared to other countries (3) . However, travel bans are not sustainable indefinitely, and a careful risk analysis needs to be done comparing the health and economic consequences of alternative scenarios. The epidemic in China peaked on February 5 th and has declined since (4) . The risk of importation of COVID-19 cases through travel from an affected country is proportional to the volume of travel from that country and their prevalence of infection at that time point. We aimed to estimate the impact of the implementation of the travel ban on China from February 1 st 2020 on the epidemic trajectory in Australia, as well as the impact of lifting the ban completely or partially from the 8 of March."

Complete travel ban from February 1st to March 8st, followed by complete lifting ban 3. Complete travel ban from February 1st to March 8st, followed by partial lifting ban (allowing university students, but not tourists, to enter the country)"
34190,The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.,"The evacuations from Wuhan and the Diamond Princess Cruise ship are not considered in this model, which only examines regular travel between China and Australia. In order to estimate the effectiveness of the travel ban that has been implemented in Australia for travellers from China, we did not consider bans to other countries. We assumed that the chance of cases coming into Australia from China depends from the number of cases in China and the number of travellers to Australia. To estimate the number of people infected that are predicted to enter Australia every two weeks from 20/01 to April, we utilised 2019 air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards, with data aggregated monthly and published by the Australia Bureau of Statistics (5) . For the purpose of this analysis air movements of passengers between China and Australia were derived from 2019 data. A baseline level of entries into Australia from China was calculated from the total number of entries over the April -Jun 2019 time period and was assumed to represent the baseline arrivals for the purpose of tourism and other business. The seasonal excess of travellers was then calculated by deducting this baseline from the January-March 2019 data. The seasonal excess arrivals were assumed to represent the arrival of international students starting the 2019 study year, which begins in February to March each year. Where travel bans were instituted in this analysis, or lifted, it was assumed that international students unable to enter Australia would return to Australia following the lifting of the ban, 60% in the rest of March and the remaining 40% over the month of April. However, tourists not able to travel during a travel ban were not assumed to enter Australia at a later date. Tourism activity was assumed to recover to baseline levels immediately after the lifting of a travel ban. The daily number of travellers from China to Australia in each month and for each scenario is showed in Table S2 of the supplementary material."
34190,The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.,"Where N is the total population of China and ( , + 14) is the number of people travelling from China to Australia in every two weeks period. When calculating the prevalence of infection in China, we started from two weeks before the period travelling in order to include the people that could be infected and in a latent state. In scenarios 2 and 3, we assumed a linear declining distribution in time of travel for university students waiting to enter the country after lifting of the travel ban. A full and partial lifting of the ban was examined. In the partial ban, over 150,000 university students can enter Australia, but the just over 80,000 expected tourists not."
34190,The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.,"The cases of COVID-19 occurring over time in Australia due to imported cases from China were estimated for each scenario. We used an age specific deterministic model, with 8 mutually exclusive compartments: susceptible (S), Latent traced (LT), Latent untraced (LU), Infectious (I), Isolated (I), Recovered (R) and dead (D). Each of those compartments is divided in 18 age stratified groups each of 5 years duration, ranging from 0 to 84 years old plus an additional age group of 85+ years. The entire Australian population was considered susceptible. The duration of each model run is 400 days. The initial infected cohort is assumed to be generated from cases arriving from China by air. After arrival of an infected case, it is assumed that, if and when they become symptomatic, they are isolated, and a designated portion of their contacts will also be quarantined. Cases transition between epidemiological compartments in accordance with transition rates determined by their duration of stay in each compartment. Model parameters are shown in Table 1 . Further details of the model (diagram and differential equations) are described in the supplementary material. We conducted a sensitivity analyses on the proportion of asymptomatic people, and based on growing evidence of equal viral loads in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases(9-12), we considered the latent period to be equally infectious as the symptomatic period. The proportion of asymptomatic infections, being the main source of community transmission in scenarios where the travel bans are lifted, was assumed to be 34.6% based on testing of passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship (13, 14) . The model uses an optimistic assumption that 80% of contacts are identified and quarantined, and 90% of symptomatic cases are isolated after 5 days (17) . Studies show a long, mild prodrome of several days before people feel unwell enough to seek medical attention, which is also considered in the model (15) . "
34190,The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.,"The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20032045 doi: medRxiv preprint We found that following the peak on February 5 th and decline of the epidemic in China, the probability that an infected traveller can arrive in the partial ban scenario (allowing university students only) is low. The complete removal of travel restrictions on 8 th of March results in an estimated arrival of 5 cases in the first two weeks and 1 in the following two weeks. However, if we compare a 5 week ban scenario (scenario 2) with the scenario without a travel ban (scenario 1), we estimate that 32, 43 and 36 infected coming every two weeks from the 26 of January would have been averted. Due to a surge of students coming in the first two weeks following the lifting of the ban in the second scenario, an additional 2 more infected are estimated to enter from 8 to 21 of March (Table 2 ). In Figure 3 we show the epidemic curve without and with the ban implemented for 5 weeks followed by a full lifting (scenario 1 and 2) and we show a large impact on averting an epidemic in Australia. In both cases, the model reproduces the 15 notified imported cases reported in Australia between the 20 of January and 8 of February. The modelled epidemic in scenario 2, with the full ban, predicts 57 cases in Australia by the 6 th of March. The notified cases by 6 th of March were 66, however we did not account for imported cases from other countries"
34190,The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.,"We estimated that the travel ban implemented on 1 of February by Australia has been very effective, reducing the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 by about 87%. Studies have been published on effectiveness of domestic and international travel restrictions on COVID-19 (19, 20) . However, this study is the first one to show the effectiveness of travel ban in Australia, and can inform a phased approach of partial lifting of bans when cases in the source country decline. This allows monitoring of the ongoing situation in China, which may yet see a second wave of the epidemic. Our estimate of the true epidemic curve is supported by other studies (7, 8, 21) , and projected case numbers would change with any change in this estimate. Even if the true number of cases in China is 10 or 100 times that reported, only a fraction of the entire population of China has been infected, which leaves a possibility of a subsequent wave of the epidemic. If cases increase in China, the model can provide estimates of risk based on daily new case numbers."
34190,The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.,"We do not consider cases coming in from other countries -however, this study illustrates the principle of travel bans and public health impact on epidemic control using China as a case study. A further limitation is the uncertainty of parameters used, particularly the proportion of asymptomatic cases. We have used a conservative estimate, but if the rate is higher than 40%, the outcomes would be worse. While it has been showed that distancing measures are highly effective (2, 22) a systematic review looking at the effectiveness of travel restrictions (23) , shows that international travel restriction are effective in delaying the epidemic but may not contain it. We also assumed a very optimistic scenario of 80% of contacts being identified, which may not occur with high case numbers, if a high proportion of asymptomatic transmission is occurring, or if self-quarantine is ineffective. In this study we assumed voluntary home quarantine, which is showed to be about 50% effective in R0 reduction (16) , however there could be an increased risk of intra-household transmission infected people to contacts (24) , which is not considered in this model."
34190,The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.,"We showed that the ban implemented for travellers from China, when the epidemic was almost at its peak, substantially delayed the spread into Australia. There is now evidence of community transmission in Australia, but the epidemic is still in the early stages, and this study provide evidence to support the new travel bans that have been implemented on Iran and South Korea, in order to delay the epidemic. The model predicted 57 cases by March 6 th in Australia, which is slightly less than the notified number of 66, which suggests the model assumptions were reasonable, given we did not account for cases coming in from other countries. Community transmission in Australia in early March is likely linked to imported cases from China, given the fairly long incubation period and less than 3 incubation periods since the first evacuation of Australians from Wuhan on February 3rd. The model fit to observed data was good, also suggesting the epidemic is still possible to contain, if adequate resources are available for thorough contact tracing."
34305,Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak occurred during the mass migration period prior to the Chinese New Year in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, a central Chinese hub for transportation and industry. On January 23, a travel ban put the city of Wuhan under quarantine, all transportations into and out of the city were canceled, impacting more than nine million people. It is reported that more than five million people have left Wuhan in the days before the travel ban [1] , which may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 to other provinces in China."
34305,Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China,"Several analyses have evaluated the impact of migration on the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, Du et al. estimated that COVID-19 may have been transported from Wuhan to more than 130 Chinese cities and all four major metropolitan areas by January 23 [2] . Tian et al. reported that the travel ban slowed the transmission of infection to other Chinese cities by an average of 2.9 days [3] . Chinazzi et al. suggested that the travel ban delayed the overall epidemic progression of COVID-19 in China by 3-5 days, and may reduce the number of cases outside of China by 80% by the end of February [4] . Further, Jin et al. and Chen et al. reported that the cumulative migration from Wuhan was highly correlated with the number of reported cases in other provinces in China, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 [5, 6] ."

We further evaluated the overall intervention effect of the Wuhan travel ban by the end of February.

34305,Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China,"Traffic volume is expressed as the Baidu Migration Index, a proprietary index derived based on cell phone positioning data and is proportional to the daily total number of people traveling out of Wuhan. Although the explicit relationship between the population size and the Baidu Migration Index is unclear, previous analysis has estimated that one unit of the index corresponds to approximately 44,520 travelers [4] . Using web scraping technique, we obtained the Baidu Migration Index data for outbound traffic from Wuhan to the 31 Chinese provinces from January 10 to February 29, 2020. We also extracted the percentage of people who traveled to each province from Baidu Migration Map. With these data, we estimated the volume of daily traffic from Wuhan to each province, calculated as Volume province,date = Total Volume date × Percentage province,date . Data for the same Lunar calendar period in 2019 were used as benchmark to make predictions for disease incidence if the travel ban had not been issued."

To account for the variation in the association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province, we first classified provinces according to their estimated time lag and correlation coefficients using K-means clustering [10] . For each province cluster, we fitted an ARIMA model with traffic volume as an external regressor, also known as an ARIMAX model. The ARIMAX model describes the value of at time using the following equations:"

The lag values identified by the crosscorrelation analysis was applied to traffic time series data in the ARIMAX model. The models were fitted using data up to the expected turning point in COVID-19 incidence following the travel ban. We used the median lag time for each cluster to determine the turning points. We used differencing to stationarize the COVID-19 incidence time series and checked stationarity using the augmented Dickey-Fuller test. The fitted ARIMAX model was used to forecast cumulative incidence till the end of February based on migration data during the same period in 2019. The difference between the predicted and observed cumulative incidence is the estimated intervention effect associated with the travel ban.
34305,Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China,"Outbound traffic from Wuhan started to increase rapidly from January 13 and fell sharply after January 23, 2020, when the travel ban was implemented ( Figure 1A-1C) . By January 23, 71% of people who traveled out of Wuhan went to other cities in Hubei province and 29% migrated to other provinces. The incidence of COVID-19 within and outside of Hubei province fluctuated in similar patterns with the change in traffic ( Figure 1E-1G) , suggesting a lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence."
34305,Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China,"The optimal ARIMAX models for each province cluster are summarized in Table 1 . The ARIMA (2,1,0) was optimal for provinces with <1 week of lag, and the ARIMA (1,1,0) was optimal for provinces with ≥1 week of lag. The model-predicted cumulative incidence based on actual traffic data demonstrated good fit with the observed incidences ( Figure 4A -4C, Table 1 ). The predicted cumulative incidences would be higher in all three clusters of provinces based on 2019 traffic data ( Figure 4D-4F) , and the differences were projected to grow larger moving forward. It is estimated that there would be approximately 2,123 more cases in provinces with <1 week lag, 4,363 more in provinces with 1 week of lag, and 13,282 more in provinces with 2-3 weeks of lag by the end of February, although the predicted value was not significantly different from the observed in provinces with <1 week of lag (Table 1) . We estimated that the travel ban may have reduced a total of 19,768 (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) cases outside of Wuhan by the end of February."
34305,Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China,"Another possible reason for the prolonged impact of migration in provinces adjacent to Hubei is that cross-province migrations are hard to shut off given the geographical proximity. Sporadic travelers from Wuhan may continue to cross provincial borders and spread the virus for a while after the travel ban. This is evident by the fact that the lag was much shorter in provinces further away from Wuhan (e.g., Tibet, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Hainan, Yunnan) or had more strict traffic control (e.g., Beijing). Furthermore, travelers to these provinces were more likely to be tourists as opposed to returning home; therefore, they have little social ties to the local population and are less likely to introduce widespread local transmissions."
34305,Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China,"The primary strength of this analysis is the use of ARIMA models to examine the temporal relationship between traffic and COVID-19 incidence, allowing us to disentangle the association from a myriad of shared common trends between the two variables. The analysis is also novel in that real-time, cellphone location-based migration data were used to measure population mobility, which is superior to methods based on historical mobility data. This analysis also fitted separate ARIMA models according to differing time-lagged impacts from traffic, leading to a more accurate estimate of the intervention effect for the travel ban."
34305,Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China,"These changes were not travel-related and may distort the estimated association to some extent. Second, the temporal association between traffic and COVID-19 could be confounded by other preventive measures, such as increased self-quarantine and widespread use of face mask and hand sanitization. Therefore, the estimated intervention effect associated with the travel ban could be overestimated. Finally, as an ecologic study, our findings may suffer from ecologic fallacy and do not necessarily imply individual-level association between travel history and risk of COVID-19 infection."
34305,Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China,"In conclusion, mass migration out of Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 outbreak in other parts of China. The outflowing migration from Wuhan had a more prolonged impact on provinces that are closer to Wuhan and have more immigration from Wuhan. Provinces with higher GDP per capita were less impacted by migration. It is estimated that approximately 39% of cases outside of Wuhan have been prevented by the travel ban issued on January 23, 2020. In the absence of cures and immunization for an emerging infectious disease like COVID-19, transportation control, an old-fashioned approach, is proven an effective public health intervention.

34521,Estimating the number of undetected COVID-19 cases exported internationally from all of China,"At the time of writing, data on air-travel volume were not available for the pre-lockdown epidemic period and total epidemic period, which we considered to be from 8 December 2019 (date of epidemic seeding in Wuhan) to 23 January 2020 and from 8 December 2019 to 28 February 2020, respectively. Historical air-travel volume data are likely not representative of the epidemic time period for two reasons : 1) Lunar New Year was earlier than in preceding years (25 January 2020), and 2) large-scale travel bans and flight cancellations took place in late January 2020. We therefore combined monthly historical air-travel volume data with recent daily flight departure data to estimate daily air-travel volume out of cities in China to our destinations of interest during the total epidemic period, as described in the Supplement."

In the case of travel bans being lifted, a rapid increase in the number of imported cases can be expected. In 2019, air passengers from New Zealand formed the largest group (≈ 2, 622, 967) of arrivals into Australia, followed by arrivals from China (≈ 1, 999, 857) States (≈ 1, 700, 860).

The risk reduction in COVID-19 importations into Australia as a result of travel bans varies across the different source countries.

In contrast, the risk reduction for travel bans relating to countries with a dominant number of returning Australian citizens or residents, such as Italy, Spain, Thailand, and Indonesia, will have a smaller impact on COVID-19 importations, as the citizens and residents can still enter the country."
34678,Symptom-Based Isolation Policies: Evidence from a Mathematical Model of Outbreaks of Influenza and COVID-19,"Respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in low-or middle-income countries (LMICs) and account for an estimated four million deaths annually [1] . Before the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, much research focused on influenza, which causes worldwide annual epidemics of seasonal resulting in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and approximately 250,000 to 500,000 deaths [2] . In the US, influenza causes on average of 226,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 to 49, 000 deaths each year [3, 4] . Control of influenza in children is an acute public health problem because attack rates (i.e., the proportion of the population infected) in unvaccinated children are estimated to average 12.7% [5] and exceed 30% during pandemic years [6] . Children also amplify the outbreak as they infect their peers and families, creating greater opportunities for further transmission in the community. [7, 8] For rapidly emerging outbreaks such as novel strains of influenza or SARS-CoV-2, pharmaceutical measures may be unavailable or less effective, and non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs) need to be used [9, 10] . NPIs are divided by the World Health Organization into categories of personal protection, social distancing, travel and environment measures [11] . However, when the WHO systematically reviewed all studies supporting each NPI for controlling pandemic influenza, it found gaps in the evidence base for many of the measures [11] . In this study, our goal is to use a computational model to examine the policy of symptom-based isolation -a form of social distancing. Under this NPI, individuals who are showing fever due to a respiratory infection are required to remain in isolation until their symptoms subside, normally followed by an additional period of one day free of fever (or antipyretic medications or steroids). The CDC currently recommends this NPI for controlling pandemic influenza and controlling influenza in schools [12, 13] . The buffer period of 1 day helps reduce transmission by keeping people in isolation when their fever symptoms temporarily subside. It also prevents transmission from viral shedding that often continues past the last episode of fever [14] . This NPI is often referred to as fever absenteeism or return-to-school policy in the context of schools."
34678,Symptom-Based Isolation Policies: Evidence from a Mathematical Model of Outbreaks of Influenza and COVID-19,"To evaluate this NPI, our model computationally simulates outbreaks of influenza and COVID -19 in school settings, and then looks at the effect of symptom-based isolation policies. The benefit of using a model is the ability to clarify and quantify the possible effects of many different policy choices. Our work builds upon numerous previous studies that have applied mathematical models to model influenza transmission in schools (see e.g. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] ). Several studies also modeled non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closures but not absenteeism policies [19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] ). We performed a systematic analysis of studies that evaluated isolation policies by using a broad search on PubMed. We found a variety of policies involving isolation of infected individuals, particularly isolation for a fixed interval following diagnosis. For example, the large modeling consortium on pandemic influenza [18] assumed students with influenza symptoms would isolate themselves but did not examine the duration of isolation. We also found several comprehensive computational studies of school closures and isolation of infected students (e.g. [18, 33] ), but did not find evaluation of policies that would reduce transmission caused by infectious students returning from home. A related policy of symptom monitoring, that isolates contacts once they show symptoms, has been examined computationally and shown to be sufficient for controlling certain outbreaks [34] ."

The results are shown in Figure 2 . . Estimated effect of requiring isolation after the last fever event in a typical school experiencing an outbreak of (a) Influenza and (b) SARS-CoV-2 (at 50% rate of cases having fever symptoms).

10651,"The effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China, in early December, 2019. 1, 2 Since then, the local and national governments have taken unprecedented measures in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2. 3 Exit screening of passengers was shortly followed by travel restrictions in Wuhan on Jan 23, 2020, halting all means of unauthorised travel into and out of the city. Similar control measures were extended to the entire province of Hubei by Jan 26, 2020. 3 Non-pharmaceutical physical distancing inter ventions, such as extended school closures and workplace distancing, were introduced to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. 4 Within the city, schools remained closed, Lunar New Year holidays were extended so that people stayed away from their workplaces, and the local government promoted physical distancing and encouraged residents to avoid crowded places. These measures greatly changed age-specific mixing patterns within the population in previous outbreak response efforts for other respiratory infectious diseases. 5, 6 Although travel restrictions undoubtedly had a role in reducing exportations of infections outside Wuhan and delayed the onset of outbreaks in other regions, 7, 8 changes in mixing patterns affected the trajectory of the outbreak within Wuhan itself. To estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, we look at Wuhan, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world."
10651,"The effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","Person-to-person transmission is mostly driven by who interacts with whom, 9, 10 which can vary by age and location of the contact (ie, school, work, home, and community). Under the context of a large-scale ongoing outbreak, contact patterns would drastically shift from their baseline conditions. In the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, physical distancing measures, including but not limited to school and workplace closures and health promotions that encourage the general public to avoid crowded places, are designed to drastically shift social mixing patterns and are often used in epidemic settings. 4 Although contact patterns can be inferred from reported social contact data that include information on which setting the contact took place in, such studies are often focused on high-income countries, 11 or particular highdensity areas. 12 This limitation can be addressed by quantifying contact patterns in the home, school, work, and other locations across a range of countries based on available information from household-level data and local population demographic structures. 13 To examine how these changes in population mixing have affected the outbreak progression, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, 1, 9, [14] [15] [16] we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptibleexposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model 17, 18 for several physical distancing measures."

For the third scenario, we modelled the effect of the intense control measures ending at the beginning of March or April, and we allowed for a staggered return to work while the school remained closed (ie, 25% of the workforce working in weeks one and two, 50% of the workforce working in weeks three and four, and 100% of the workforce working and school resuming ( figure 2 ). 3,23,24 "

Intense control measures of prolonged school closure and work holidays reduced the cumulative infections by end-2020 and peak incidence, while also delaying the peak of the outbreak (figure 4). Our model suggests that the effects of these physical distancing strategies vary across age categories; the reduction in incidence is highest among school children and older individuals and lowest among working-age adults ( figure 4; figure 5 )."
10651,"The effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","The modelled effects of the intense control measures of prolonged school closure and work holidays vary by the duration of infectiousness. If the disease had a short infectious period (3 days), then our model suggests that relaxing physical distancing interventions in March (figure 5; appendix p 4) could avert around 30% of cases in school children and older individuals. Fewer cases could be averted by end-2020 should the disease have a longer duration of infectiousness (eg, 7 days; figure 5); physical distancing interventions would need to be relaxed a month later (in April) to observe a larger effect. If children were less infectious, lifting physical distancing interventions in April instead of March could engender additional health benefits (figure 5; appendix pp 5-6)."
10651,"The effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","COVID-19, a contact-transmissible infectious disease, is thought to spread through a population via direct contact between individuals. 1, 9, 10 Outbreak control measures aimed at reducing the amount of mixing in the population have the potential to delay the peak and reduce the final size of the epidemic. To evaluate the effect of location-specific physical distancing measures-such as extended school closures and interventions in workplaces-on the timing and magnitude of the peak and the final size of the epidemic, we accounted for these heterogeneities in contact networks in our model. We simulated outbreaks and modelled the interventions by scaling down the appropriate component of the contact mixing matrices for China."
10651,"The effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","Mathematical models can help us understand how SARS-CoV-2 could spread across the population and inform control measures that might mitigate future transmission. 25, 26 We simulated the trajectory of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan using an agestructured SEIR model. 17, 18 As individuals' mixing patterns are non-random, they influence the transmission dynamics of the disease. 11 Models that assess the effectiveness of physical distancing interventions, such as school closure, need to account for social structures and heterogeneities in mixing of individuals. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] In our model, we incorporated changes to age-specific and location-specific social mixing patterns to estimate the effects of location-specific physical distancing interventions in curtailing the spread of the outbreak. The measures put in place to reduce contacts at schools and workplaces are helping control the outbreak by providing the health-care system with the time and opportunity to expand and respond. Consequently, if these restrictions are lifted prematurely, while there are still enough susceptible people to keep the R e >1 once contacts increase, the number of infections would increase. Realistically, interventions are lifted slowly, partly as an attempt to avoid a sharp increase in infection, but also for logistical and practical reasons. Therefore, we simulated lifting the interventions in a staggered fashion. Evidence of the effects of various physical dis tancing measures on containing the outbreak are scarce and little is known about the behavioural changes of individuals over time, either during an outbreak or otherwise. Therefore, to model the effects of the physical distancing measures implemented in Wuhan, we assumed the effect that certain types of physical distancing have on age-specific and location-specific contact rates."
10651,"The effect of control strategies to reduce social mixing on outcomes of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China: a modelling study","This study describes a mathematical model that quantifies the potential impacts of physical distancing policies, relying on Wuhan as a case study. Epidemiological investigations during the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 found many infections clustered around households. 34 Extreme physical distancing measures, including school closures, workplace closures, and avoidance of any public gatherings all at once can push the transmission to households, leading to increased clustering of household cases. 5 As households are not explicitly included in the model, we did not consider heterogeneity and clustering of household transmission. Distinguishing between repeated and new contacts is important for disease propagation in contact network models; 35,36 more sophisticated methods that account for temporal presence within the household 37 would be needed to characterise higher degrees of contact. Looking at limitations of our study, our compartmental model does not capture individual-level heterogeneity in contacts, which could be important in super-spreading events, particularly early in an epidemic. Combined with nosocomial infections, the risk of COVID-19 infection is potentially amplified with close contact between confirmed cases and health-care workers. However, the compartmental model we present is not equipped to explicitly consider transmission within health-care institutions and households. More complex models, such as individual-based models with familial and health-care structures, should be explored. No socomial infection risk among health-care workers and patients has been identified as a research gap to be prioritised in the next few months by WHO."
34433,"Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","School closures are a common measure of pandemic mitigation for many countries, driven by the logic that social distancing reduces transmission. [1] [2] [3] Although school closures are known to reduce transmission, previous works have suggested that school closures could have downstream consequences on the healthcare system such as healthcare worker absenteeism. 4, 5 However, lack of granular, high-resolution data has restrained previous studies to providing estimates based on national data with strong assumptions, underscoring the need for more detailed analysis. 3 Newly available demographic and occupational data from the American Community Survey permits county-level scenario analyses of school closures with respect to healthcare worker absenteeism across the United States for the first time."
34433,"Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","In the absence of a federal mandate for school closures, the decision of whether or not to close a school is determined by local authorities. The needs and capabilities of both schools and healthcare systems vary drastically across the United States, so county-level simulations of healthcare worker absenteeism and school closures could be far more impactful and targeted for local communities than state or national-level simulations. China's CDC reports that patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes had higher rates of fatality from COVID-19 (0.9% case fatality with no reported comorbidities, 10.5% and 7.3% for comorbidities of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, respectively). 6 The prevalence of these comorbidities also varies geographically in the US, further highlighting the importance of regional analysis. [7] [8] [9] To maintain healthcare systems in the event of a school closure, it could be beneficial to assist healthcare workers with child care. Previous work has shown that increased wages are associated with lower absenteeism, so it is possible that child care subsidies could reduce absenteeism by alleviating the financial burden of child care for healthcare workers as well as further incentivizing them to remain at work. 10, 11 Furthermore, the costs of child care (which is the main barrier to finding child care) and the salaries of healthcare workers vary regionally, so the necessity of child care subsidization for healthcare workers could also vary regionally. 12 Here, we provide county-level microsimulation analyses on the potential effects of COVID-19 school closures on healthcare worker absenteeism and hospital bed demand across the entirety of the United States over a range of plausible scenarios. We estimate projected healthcare worker absenteeism, county-level associations between absenteeism and severe COVID-19 risk factors, and the effectiveness of school closures on reducing hospital bed demand; we also identify child care subsidies as a potential solution to help maintain healthcare systems during a pandemic.

We focus our analyses on households with children below age 13 -although children under the age of 5 do not attend school, daycare services would likely also be closed in the event of school closures."

At both the national and county-level, we draw 1000 simulations from a multinomial distribution. We determine absenteeism by simulating whether a healthcare worker is the primary caregiver of a household, and whether they are able to find alternative child care in the event of a school closure.

Transmission events occur through contact between susceptible and infectious individuals. Since rates of contact differ between age groups, we constructed a WAIFW (Who Acquires Infection From Whom) matrix from non-physical and physical contact data between age groups. 22 We assume that social distancing will result in a 50% reduction of interactions and school closures will result in a 90% reduction in interactions among children. 23 Since increased household interactions is often cited as an unintended side effect of school closures 2425 , we also increase interactions between children and other age groups by 10%."

Since the COVID-19 epidemic curve is over a short duration, we ignore births, death, and immigration. We assume that 86% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, with asymptomatic individuals as 50% less infectious than symptomatic individuals. 27 Symptomatic individuals are assumed to reduce contact by 75%. Age-stratified hospitalization rates and infection fatality ratios were obtained from Verity et al. 28 We choose to only apply the infection fatality ratios to symptomatic individuals to obtain a conservative estimate. COVID-19 is not currently known to have reinfections, so we assume that individuals develop immunity after infection in the short term. To estimate the demand on the healthcare system, we assume that 30% of hospitalizations will require critical care (invasive mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, or further intensive care-level intervention), and that individuals requiring hospitalization will stay for 8 days and individuals requiring critical care will stay in the ICU for 10.4 days. 25 We calculate peak hospitalization and ICU bed demand by integrating the number of individuals within ±4 days and ±5 days of the time with the maximum number of patients, respectively. To simulate the effects on a particular county, we seed the simulation for county age demographics. We estimate the effectiveness of school closures by calculating the reduction in peak ICU bed demand between social distancing and social distancing plus school closure conditions."

34433,"Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","We observe a number of counties that could be viable targets for child care subsidies based on our estimates (Table 1, Figure 3 ). Counties like Conecuh County, Alabama, have high rates of diabetes, projected absenteeism, as well as a high ω, suggesting that they would suffer disproportionately from COVID-19 in the event of school closures, but also that a child care subsidy would be relatively inexpensive for them. Similarly, Hidalgo County, Texas and Fresno County, California have high projected absenteeism rates and ω, suggesting they are viable targets for child care subsidies. San Francisco County, California is one of the few counties with ω < 1 (due to high child care costs, low wages, and low projected absenteeism), illustrating the variance of our estimates within states. Counties like Morrison County in Minnesota or Franklin County in Pennsylvania that have high projected school closure effectiveness but also high projected absenteeism rates, could also consider child care subsidies given the large estimated benefit of school closures. "
34433,"Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","We observed large variance of our estimates between counties for all of our county-level analyses, emphasizing the importance of county-level information. Our transmission models projected reduced hospitalizations from school closures, but it is highly likely that hospitalizations and ICU bed demand would still far exceed bed capacity for many hospitals. 25 Furthermore, our models estimated generally high absenteeism rates (> 7%) across different assumptions, highlighting the need for reducing absenteeism in the event of school closures. Our regression analysis estimated that counties that are already vulnerable to COVID-19 complications due to diabetes prevalence would also have higher rates of absenteeism from school closures, illustrating an exacerbated scenario in the absence of adequate child care."
34433,"Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","To identify a potential approach to reducing absenteeism, we estimated that the vast majority of counties (> 98%) could save money by providing child care to their healthcare workers with children in the event of a school closure (ω > 1). Although it is likely that many child care avenues would also be closed in the event of school closures, subsidized child care costs could still prevent absenteeism by (1) incentivizing work attendance with extra wages, and (2) alleviating the financial burden on the entire household, enabling other family or household members to participate in child care."
34433,"Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","Our findings contribute to the literature of school closures during pandemics by providing county-level estimates of absenteeism and school closure effectiveness, relating those estimates to county-level COVID-19 complication factors, and providing an economic analysis of child care subsidies. In previous works, Sadique et al and Lempel et al provided national level cost analyses of school closures under a variety of model assumptions and closure lengths. 4, 5 In a recent preprint, Bayham and Fenichel provide state-level estimates and include a tradeoff analysis on whether closing schools reduces mortality after accounting for disruption to healthcare systems from absenteeism. Given the close tradeoff in mortality for school closures and absenteeism, we believe it would be beneficial to explore ways to circumvent the ostensible tradeoff through child care"
34433,"Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 19.20039404 doi: medRxiv preprint subsidies. 32 As a simulation study, there are important limitations to our analysis. Simulations rely on assumptions to make predictions, and ours use assumptions derived from available data. For example, we do not know the number of healthcare workers with dependents -we estimate this based on representative data that could be inaccurate for some regions. Similarly, there are no datasets that tell us how many healthcare workers would be unable to find child care in the event of school closures -we instead estimate this using representative microdata. Lack of available data prohibits us from making precise estimates for counties with small populations. Given the current uncertainty of transmission parameters, our transmission models should not be used to accurately predict infection and hospitalization rates, but rather to estimate the relative effectiveness of school closures based on the age-demographics of each county. Additionally, although our economic analysis demonstrates the affordability of a child care subsidy, our method does not prove that child care subsidies would necessarily reduce absenteeism resulting from school closures. We emphasize that our work does not argue for or against school closures due to currently unclear fatality and transmission data, but rather that we highlight areas that would suffer more in the event of school closure and could therefore benefit more from child care subsidies."
34433,"Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","Further research should investigate whether child care subsidies for healthcare workers would reduce absenteeism in the event of school closures from a pandemic. Additionally, research efforts should identify how school closures in pandemics impact more vulnerable populations for whom robust data does not currently exist. Further research efforts should also be placed to determine the effect of school closures on the absenteeism of other kinds of essential workers, instead of just healthcare workers."
34433,"Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","Our results provide detailed estimates that could help local communities prepare for the event of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially for future pandemics. Such preparations could help reduce preventable harm resulting from school closures."
34592,Age-dependent effects in the transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics,"School closures during epidemics 29, 30 and pandemics 31, 32 aim to slow the spread of infections by decreasing transmission amongst children 12 is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity."
34592,Age-dependent effects in the transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics,"To fully explore the effect of school closure we simulated 3 months of school closures with varying infectiousness of subclinical cases, at either 0, 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 times the infectiousness of clinical cases ( Fig 3d) . We found that school closures decreased peak incidence slightly for influenza-like infections, and delayed the peak substantially. For COVID-19 epidemics, the delay and decrease of the peak was smaller, and this was especially the case in Bulawayo, which has the highest proportion of children (Fig 3e) ."
34592,Age-dependent effects in the transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics,"Because children exhibit more subclinical cases for COVID-19, school closures were more effective at reducing transmission of COVID-19 when the subclinical infectiousness was assumed to be higher (Fig 3f) ."
34592,Age-dependent effects in the transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics,"The age-specific distribution of subclinical infection we have found is similar in shape (but larger in scale) to that generally assumed for pandemic influenza. However, for the 2009 influenza A/H1N1p pandemic, the age-specific susceptibility to infection was lower in older individuals compared to COVID-19. These differences have a large effect on how effective school closures may be in limiting transmission, delaying the peak of expected cases, and decreasing the total and peak number of cases. For COVID-19, school closures are likely to be much less effective than for influenza-like infections where children play a more substantial role in transmission."
34592,Age-dependent effects in the transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics,"The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043018 doi: medRxiv preprint / overall burden in the groups at risk of severe disease, primarily older populations for COVID-19 21 , remains high. If those with subclinical infections are (much) less efficient at transmitting, then the overall contribution to the burden of clinical disease in the population may be proportionally lower. At the same time, lower relative infectiousness would reduce the impact of interventions targeting younger ages, such as school closure. By analysing epidemic dynamics before and after school closures, it may be possible to estimate the infectiousness of subclinical infections, however this will rely on granular data by age and time."
34592,Age-dependent effects in the transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics,We projected the impact of school closure by setting the contact multiplier for school contacts school(t) to 0. Complete removal of school contacts may overestimate the impact of school closures because of alternative contacts children make when out of school 57 . This will however give the maximum impact of school closures in the model to demonstrate the differences.
34808,Assessing the interactions between COVID-19 and influenza in the United States,"In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases caused by a novel coronavirus were identified in Wuhan, China. In the months since, the now-termed COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread around the world, leading to hundreds of thousands of cases in over 160 countries [1] . The first evidence of community spread of SARS-Cov-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, in the United States appeared in February 2020. Since then, there have been widespread workplace, school, and business closures to dampen transmission [2] . Preceding this widespread policy response, individuals, informed by massive media coverage, engaged in voluntary behaviors such as increased handwashing and social distancing [3] . Such non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are known 1 to play a significant role in diminishing transmission, and are expected to be particularly important against SARS-Cov-2 as the virus appears to transmit for up to two weeks before symptoms appear [4] . Indeed, NPIs have been very e↵ective in reducing the potential number of COVID-19 cases in China [5, 6] . As the COVID-19 outbreak unfolds, it is important to empirically understand the e↵ects of NPIs on infection spread, and characterize the potential interaction between COVID-19 and other circulating respiratory infections. As the spread of COVID-19 in the United States has been temporally coincidental with the influenza season, and both infections share the same transmission pathways and NPIs, we focus on influenza as a case study."
34808,Assessing the interactions between COVID-19 and influenza in the United States,"To understand the process of respiratory disease transmission and mitigation, we developed a metapopulation model that represents age-specific contact between children and adults within metropolitan areas and is spatially divided into metropolitan areas linked through air tra c flows. The model is described in detail in [7] . We simulated a seasonal influenza epidemic in the US, including typical holiday school closure, and seasonality with the season ending at April 30, 2020. We then incorporated reduction in age-structured transmission by (1 ⌧ (t)), where is the intensity of transmission decrease, which relates to the increase in risk perception level of ⌧ (t). We parameterize ⌧ (t) based on daily Google trends for COVID-19 and fit to assess the degree to which influenza transmission is reduced in the early stages of COVID-19 in the US. We consider two main possible mechanisms by which COVID-19 may have resulted in decreased transmission: 1) increased risk perception of respiratory transmitted disease resulting in precautionary behaviors, like increased handwashing, that reduce potentially transmissible contacts and 2) isolation of infected individuals, either due to undetected COVID-19 spread, or increased messaging surrounding remaining home if one is feeling ill for any reason."
34808,Assessing the interactions between COVID-19 and influenza in the United States,"We suggest that the link between increased risk perception and decreased disease transmission is heightened protective behaviors through non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). This conjecture is supported by past studies that have shown that risk perception is a strong predictor of preventative health behaviors [21] . However, the timing of this e↵ect (early to mid February) is important to consider. The decrease in the observed US ILI peak occurred before widespread closures of public spaces and implementation of social distancing to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. Our results could indicate that the use of personal NPIs such as handwashing and voluntary social distancing may have been occurring before policy changes took place in March 2020. In a survey conducted in early February 2020, US respondents rated their risk perception of COVID-19 as a median score of 5 out of 10, and more than 90% of participants were aware of infection prevention measures [22] . Our mechanistic model suggests that an average of 5% reduction in transmission likelihood could result in the ILI dynamics observed of the 2019-2020 season. Past studies have shown that frequent, e↵ective handwashing can result in a comparable moderate reduction in infections [23, 24, 25] . A meta-analysis of the e↵ects of NPIs in reducing influenza transmission demonstrated that hand hygiene was significant in reducing influenza transmission, with an odds ratio of 0.62 [26] ."
37558,Mitigate the effects of home confinement on children during the COVID-19 outbreak,"In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the Chinese Government has ordered a nationwide school closure as an emergency measure to prevent spreading of the infection. Public activities are discouraged. The Ministry of Education estimates that more than 220 million children and adolescents are confined to their homes; this includes 180 million primary and secondary students and 47 million preschool children). 1 Thanks to the strong administrative system in China, the emergency home schooling plan has been rigorously implemented. 2 Massive efforts are being made by schools and teachers at all levels to create online courses and deliver them through TV broadcasts and the internet in record time. The new virtual semester has just started in many parts of the country, and various courses are offered online in a well organised manner. These actions are helping to alleviate many parents' concerns about their children's educational attainment by ensuring that school learning is largely undisrupted."
37558,Mitigate the effects of home confinement on children during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Although these measures and efforts are highly commendable and necessary, there are reasons to be concerned because prolonged school closure and home confinement during a disease outbreak might have negative effects on children's physical and mental health. 3, 4 Evidence suggests that when children are out of school (eg, weekends and summer holidays), they are physically less active, have much longer screen time, irregular sleep patterns, and less favourable diets, resulting in weight gain and a loss of cardiorespiratory fitness. 3, 5 Such negative effects on health are likely to be much worse when children are confined to their homes without outdoor activities and interaction with same aged friends during the outbreak."
37558,Mitigate the effects of home confinement on children during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Perhaps a more important but easily neglected issue is the psychological impact on children and adolescents. Stressors such as prolonged duration, fears of infection, frustration and boredom, inadequate information, lack of in-person contact with classmates, friends, and teachers, lack of personal space at home, and family financial loss can have even more problematic and enduring effects on children and adolescents. 4 For example, Sprang and Silman 6 showed that the mean post traumatic stress scores were four times higher in children who had been quarantined than in those who were not quarantined. Furthermore, the interaction between lifestyle changes and psychosocial stress caused by home confinement could further aggravate the detrimental effects on child physical and mental health, which could cause a vicious circle. To mitigate the consequences of home confinement, the government, nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), the community, school, and parents need to be aware of the downside of the situation and do more to effectively address these issues immediately. Experiences learned from previous outbreaks can be valuable for designing a new programme to tackle these issues in China. 7 The Chinese Government needs to raise the awareness of potential physical and mental health impacts of home confinement during this unusual period. The government should also provide guidelines and principles in effective online learning and ensure that the contents of the courses meet the educational requirements. Yet it is also important not to overburden the students. The government might mobilise existing resources, perhaps involving NGOs, and create a platform for gathering the best online education courses about healthy lifestyle and psychosocial support programmes available for schools to choose from. For example, in addition physical activities, appropriate diet, and good sleep habits, and integrate such health promotion materials into the school curriculum. 3 In the event of home confinement, parents are often the closest and best resource for children to seek help from. Close and open communication with children is the key to identifying any physical and psychological issues and to comforting children in prolonged isolation. 10, 11 Parents are often important role models in healthy behaviour for children. Good parenting skills become particularly crucial when children are confined at home. Besides monitoring child performance and behaviour, parents also need to respect their identity and needs, and they need to help children develop selfdiscipline skills. Children are constantly exposed to epidemic-related news, so having direct conversations with children about these issues could alleviate their anxiety and avoid panic. 10, 11 Home confinement could offer a good opportunity to enhance the interaction between parents and children, involve children in family activities, and improve their self-sufficiency skills. With the right parenting approaches, family bonds can be strengthened, and child psychological needs met. 12 Since the COVID-19 epidemic is no longer confined to China, 13 school closure and home confinementrelated issues also become relevant in other affected countries. As children are vulnerable to environmental risks and their physical health, mental health, and productivity in adult life is deeply rooted in early years, 14 close attention and great efforts are required to address these emergency issues effectively and avoid any longterm consequences in children. Any sustainable programme must involve local professionals to culturally adapt the interventions to the administrative system and to the regional and community environment, and it must develop contextually relevant material for children and adolescents. 7 "
