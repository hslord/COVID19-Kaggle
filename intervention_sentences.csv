34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,It is apparent from results generated by our simulation model that both the timing and strength of social distancing measures have a substantial effect in reducing the number of infected individuals in a pandemic situation
34459,The Effectiveness of Social Distancing in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread: a modelling analysis,"The modelling results suggest that even with a significant delay in invoking mitigation strategies, 10 weeks in the case of data presented in Figure 1 , this delay and consequential growth in case numbers may be countered by the scale of interventions adopted, by combining multiple robust social distancing measures."

34504,Simulation-based Estimation of the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran,"Implementing, and sustaining, strong policies that target social distancing offers the main hope for containing the epidemic."
34504,Simulation-based Estimation of the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran,"In fact many mild or moderately sick patients may have preferred to stay home than risk being infected upon visiting a congested hospital, further reducing demand for testing."
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"In the absence of a vaccine, social distancing remains the only option to slow down the spread of the disease and arrest potential mortality"
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"For example, in the last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and the White House have recommended extreme social distancing in order to slow down the current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (5)"
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,There is still a great deal of uncertainty as to how strong social distancing recommendations must be or how long they must last
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"Importantly, national and regional social distancing policies are likely to impact individual cities differently."
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"This is often called the vaccination rate, p R , which is equally relevant in the context of social distancing (as only the means of the intervention and its duration differ)"
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"Second, social distancing will impact cities differently based on city size"
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"From the perspective of containing the outbreak, larger cities require more aggressive social distancing policies, corresponding to a larger p R "
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"At the same time, once the outbreak is contained it might be possible to relax social distancing policies in smaller cities first, allowing a faster return to normal life and economic activity compared to more populous cities."
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"Because of their higher network density, insufficient social distancing in larger or typically more connected cities may lead to bigger outbreaks and to the creation of reservoirs for the disease, which can continue to create introductions elsewhere"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"To keep critical care capacities from being overwhelmed, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary (7) "
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"The duration of social distancing measures needed to maintain control of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the context of seasonally varying transmission remains unclear, as does the impact of increasing critical care capacity on the overall trajectory of the outbreak"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"We simulated social distancing by reducing R0 by a fixed proportion, which ranged between 0 and 60%, on par with the reduction in R0 achieved in China through intense social distancing measures (3) "
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"We assessed 'one-time' social distancing interventions, for which R0 was reduced by up to 60% for a fixed duration of time (up to 20 weeks) starting two weeks after epidemic establishment"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"We also assessed intermittent social distancing measures, for which social distancing was turned 'on' when the prevalence of infection rose above a threshold and 'off' when it fell below a second, lower threshold, with the goal of keeping the number of critical care patients below 0.89 per 10,000 adults"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Finally, we assessed the impact of doubling critical care capacity (and the associated on/off thresholds) on the frequency and overall duration of the period social distancing measures."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,We evaluated the impact of one-time social distancing efforts of varying effectiveness and duration on the peak and timing of the epidemic with and without seasonal forcing
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"When transmission is not subject to seasonal forcing, one-time social distancing measures reduce the epidemic peak size (Figure 1, Figure S4 )"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Under all scenarios, there was a resurgence of infection when the simulated social distancing measures were lifted"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"However, longer and more stringent social distancing did not always correlate with greater reductions in epidemic peak size"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"In the case of a 20-week period of social distancing with 60% reduction in R0, for example, the resurgence peak size is nearly the same as the peak size of the uncontrolled epidemic: the social distancing is so effective that virtually no population immunity is built"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,The greatest reductions in peak size come from social distancing intensity and duration that divide cases approximately equally between peaks (12) .
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Strong social distancing maintains a high proportion of susceptible individuals in the population, leading to an intense epidemic when R0 rises in the late autumn and winter"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Intermittent social distancing can prevent critical care capacity from being exceeded (Figure 3 , Figure S6 )"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Due to the natural history of infection, there is an approximately 3-week lag between the start of social distancing and the peak critical care demand"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"When transmission is seasonally forced, summertime social distancing can be less frequent than when R0 remains constant at its maximal wintertime value throughout the year"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Under current critical care capacities, however, the overall duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic could last into 2022, requiring social distancing measures to be in place between 25% (for wintertime R0 = 2 and seasonality, Figure  S3A ) and 70% (for wintertime R0 = 2.5 and no seasonality, Figure S2C ) of that time."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Increasing critical care capacity allows population immunity to be accumulated more rapidly, reducing the overall duration of the epidemic and the total length of social distancing measures (Figure 3 C-D) "
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"While the frequency and duration of the social distancing measures is similar between the scenarios with current and expanded critical care capacity, the epidemic concludes by July 2022 and social distancing measures can be fully relaxed by early-to mid-2021, depending again on the degree of seasonal forcing of transmission (Figure 3 C-D) "
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"A single period of social distancing will not be sufficient to prevent critical care capacities from being overwhelmed by the COVID-19 epidemic, because under any scenario considered it leaves enough of the population susceptible that a rebound in transmission after the end of the period will lead to an epidemic that exceeds this capacity"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Intermittent social distancing can maintain the prevalence of critical COVID-19 illness within current capacities, but this strategy could prolong the overall duration of the epidemic into 2022"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Our findings agree with observational and modelling studies (2,7) that find that early implementation of strong social distancing is essential for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and that, in the absence of the development of new therapies or preventative measures, such as aggressive case finding and quarantining (13) , intermittent distancing measures may be the only way to avoid overwhelming critical care capacity while building population immunity"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"The observation that strong social distancing can lead to especially large resurgences agrees with data from the 1918 influenza pandemic in the United States (14), in which the size of the autumn 1918 peak of infection was inversely associated with that of a subsequent winter peak after interventions were no longer in place."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"To implement an effective intermittent social distancing strategy, it will be necessary to carry out widespread surveillance to monitor when the prevalence thresholds that trigger the beginning or end of distancing have been crossed"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Under some circumstances, intense social distancing may be able to reduce the prevalence of COVID-19 enough to warrant a shift in strategy to contact tracing and containment efforts, as has occurred in many parts of China (13, 15, 16) "
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Still, countries that have achieved this level of control of the outbreak should prepare for the possibility of substantial resurgences of infection and a return to social distancing measures, especially if seasonal forcing contributes to a rise in transmissibility in the winter."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,Treatments or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 would reduce the duration and intensity of social distancing required to maintain control of the epidemic
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Still, the development and widespread adoption of pharmaceutical interventions will take months at best, so a period of sustained or intermittent social distancing will almost certainly be necessary."
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"If SARS-CoV-2 immunity wanes rapidly, social distancing measures may need to be extended longer"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"However, if there are many undocumented asymptomatic infections that lead to immunity (19) , less social distancing may be required"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,Social distancing strategies will require further evaluation as longitudinal serological studies clarify the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-Cov-2.
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"One-time social distancing efforts will push the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak into the autumn, potentially exacerbating the load on critical care resources if there is increased wintertime transmissibility"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Intermittent social distancing can maintain critical care demand within current thresholds, but widespread surveillance will be required to time the distancing measures correctly and avoid overshooting critical care capacity"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"New therapeutics, vaccines, or other interventions such as aggressive contact tracing and quarantine -impractical now in many places but more practical once case numbers have been reduced and testing scaled up (20)could alleviate the need for stringent social distancing to maintain control of the epidemic"
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,The effectiveness of social distancing varied from none to a 60% reduction in R0
34508,Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic,"Long-term (20-week), moderately effective (20%-40%) social distancing yields the smallest overall peak and total outbreak size."

34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,First we examine the counterfactuals: what would have happened had the travel ban from Wuhan/China not been implemented
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,We simulate our stochastic meta-population model 1000 times to generate estimates of: the cumulative number of imported cases in each country (see Figures 1 and 2 ) and the projected epidemic curves in Australia both in the presence and absence of travel bans.
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,"However, the introduction of travel bans on international passengers arriving from Iran, South Korea and Italy, does not lead to a significant decrease in the expected COVID-19 importation count to Australia"
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,"Finally, we explored the effects of travel ban and other intervention -such as reducing contacts to lower the basic reproduction number -on delaying widespread local transmission within Australia"
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,"We found that without travel bans, Australia would have experienced local transmission as early as Jan 15 and possibly have become the Pacific epicenter"
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,"However, with the China travel ban in place, this delayed the widespread occurrence of local transmission by approximately one month (see Figure  3 )"
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,In this short communication we have used international flight data and models of disease transmission to predict the national epidemic trajectory had travel bans not been put in place
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,Our results show that the travel ban on individuals arriving from China successfully delayed the onset of widespread transmission in Australia by four weeks
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,"We also showed that travel bans from Hubei Province alone would have been much less effective, as the virus had already spread to many other provinces by the time the bans were enforced"
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,"Similarly, until now travel bans for South Korea and Iran (imposed on February 9 and March 5 respectively) were also shown to have negligible impact"
34512,Delaying the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia: Evaluating the effectiveness of international travel bans,"Universal international travel bans coming into force now appear to be the only rational response, however, we need to consider how long they can and should last."
34534,Spatio-temporal propagation of COVID-19 pandemics,"In the absence of both medicine and vaccination, strategies of effective distributing of them are not considered yet [5] and the options to stop the propagation of the disease are currently to quarantines the infected individuals [6] and social distancing [7] in order to cut the infection channels"
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"While the world awaits the development of vaccines and anti-viral medications, traditional public health measures such as isolation of confirmed or suspected cases, quarantine of contacts, and social distancing of the public are effective measures to reduce viral transmission 2, 3 , that have been implemented in many regions and countries 4, 5 ."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Practically, viral transmission is attenuated by isolation, quarantine and social distancing 8, 9, 10 "
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"For example, case isolation decreases the degree of Vi, while quarantine decreases the degree of vertices connected to Vi"
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"When individuals practice social distancing such as staying at home, contacts will spend more time with each other by a factor of 1.5"
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Then strict social distancing limits contacts to the household setting and shopping for essential supplies, i.e., 6.3 unique individuals (3.3 in household and 3 in nonhousehold settings), degree of separation 11.5"
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"(See supplementary materials for calculations.) After public health measures are implemented under baseline assumptions, the daily mean reproductive number decreases from 3.86 to 1.99 by social distancing, to 0.79 by isolating all cases at medical facilities, and to 0.41 by quarantine of case contacts, corresponding to the trajectory in Figure 1 "
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"During the social distancing period, 81% of new cases are predicted to be through household transmission."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041798 doi: medRxiv preprint After social distancing, regional, then national quarantine, the daily mean reproductive number has been decreasing"
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Initial social distancing is estimated to reduce contacts from 28.5 to 11.5, that is, an average of 3.6 contacts in the household setting and 7.9 in the non-household setting, degree of separation 7.35"
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Therefore, assuming full compliance with social distancing, the reproductive number is predicted to be 1.03"
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Then to contain the epidemic, in addition to public health measures such as contact tracing and quarantine, the average number of unique close contacts per person should be less than 7 over the 5 day generation interval of COVID-19, (3 household contacts and 4 non-household contacts)"
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Lastly, we calculate the threshold above which prolonged social distancing measures are needed"
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Without social distancing, if a single individual is infected with COVID-19, the average probability that any given person will be infected is (R0/k̅ ) d = (2.39/19.3) 6.63 = 0.967 × 10 -6 , or 1 in 1.03 million"
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Thus, if 1.03 million people become infected in the U.S., then it is likely that the epidemic will reach every person through networks of social contact, unless social distancing is kept in place until vaccines and anti-viral medications become available."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"It shows the importance of social distancing, and the message that to contain the epidemic, every member of the public plays a crucial part in breaking the chain of transmission."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Once daily new cases are decreasing, social distancing measures can be gradually relaxed, in phases, to prevent rebound of viral transmission."
34540,A Social Network Model of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"After social distancing becomes widely implemented and most people stay at home, the majority of new cases is expected to be from household transmission"
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"The so called ""social distancing"" strategy aims to reduce social interactions within the population decreasing the probability of transmission of the infection, represented by the parameter k in the model"
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"Why reducing R 0 by social distancing reduces total infections and the peak infected fraction, which is critical due to the limited hospital infrastructure, (or termination of the epidemic if R 0 < 1) it has the following possible problems:"
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,• since the Covid-19 infection results in mild or no symptoms in a large majority of the population and often remains undetected it is difficult to prevent further transmission (this may be one of the reasons why drastic social distancing introduced in Western Europe had limited success so far)
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,• if R 0 remains > 1 the social distancing can significantly extend the duration of the epidemic making it difficult to maintain the reduced transmissions over a long time period in a large population
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"Since at the end of the epidemic a large proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, after relaxation of social distancing, the population is highly susceptible to recurrent epidemic outbreaks due to remaining undetected or imported infections from other regions/countries where the infection has not been eliminated yet"
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,• social distancing measures over extended period of time applied uniformly to a large population leads to widespread disruption of the functioning of the society and economy therefore it has a huge long term cost
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,While social distancing aims to reduce the total infected by decreasing R 0 (see continuous curve showing I total vs R 0 in Fig
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"Since the isolation strategy targets a small portion of the population which is less socially active and has a low participation in the economy, a radical isolation is likely to be much more efficient than uniform social distancing, with smaller cost for the economy and the functioning of the society."
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,According to our model the social distancing (represented by the horizontal arrow in Fig
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"However, social distancing extends the duration of the epidemic (which may affect the sustainability of efficient isolation) and results in insufficient overall immunity of the majority population against a recurrence of the epidemic outbreak triggered by hidden or newly imported infection"
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"Therefore, when targeted isolation is implemented with high efficiency, it is preferable to avoid or apply moderate social distancing only to allow a large proportion of the majority population to become infected and develop immunity, at the cost of mostly minor symptoms similarly to a conventional flu season."
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"Some countries, for example Italy and Spain, implemented severe social distancing, but so far seems to be unable to stop the progress of the epidemic and may in fact be on track towards achieving large scale immunity in the population"
34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"However, with too much focus on the implementation of uniform social distancing and no clear targeted measures for identifying and efficiently protecting the vulnerable sub-population can lead to a very dangerous scenario with high mortality in spite of the high social and economic costs of an extended and potentially recurrent epidemic"

34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"First, how does the lockdown of the city of Wuhan amid the Novel Coronavirus outbreak affect population movement? Second, how do population flows among Chinese cities, particularly outflows from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, affect virus infection in the destination cities? Third, is there evidence of, and if so, what is the magnitude of, undocumented cases of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province during the early stages of the epidemic? And how does the extent of undocumented infection cases evolve over time? Fourth, how many COVID-19 cases elsewhere in China were prevented by the unprecedented Wuhan lockdown? Fifth, are social distancing policies in destination cities effective in reducing the spread of the infections? We utilize reliable datasets on population migration among pairs of Chinese cities and the within-city population movements of each city at the daily level from Baidu Migration, and the city-level daily numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases, recovered patients, and death tolls from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) during a sample period of January 1-February 29, 2020, covering 22 days before and 38 days after the city lockdown on January 23, 2020, as well as the matched data from the same lunar calendar period in 2019."
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"We find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities"
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,We also find evidence that imposing enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei province is effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities elsewhere.
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"The NPIs they consider include travel bans and restrictions, contact reductions and social distancing, early case identification and isolation"
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"In Section 5, we study how the enhanced social distancing policies, or ""lockdown"" policies, in the destination cities' impact the effects of the population inflows from the epicenter cities"
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"We also find that the estimated daily new cases in the counterfactual world gradually converge to the reported daily cases from February 22, suggesting that the social distancing measures implemented elsewhere in China would have worked eventually to contain the spread of 2019-nCoV virus, even if the city of Wuhan was not locked down on January 23 2020, but the initial onslaught on the medical system in all cities in China would have been much more severe, and the total number of infection cases elsewhere would have been significantly higher."
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"As the 2019-nCoV virus spread throughout the world, many countries are also implementing lockdown measures, and mandate social distancing as a policy response to contain the spread of the virus"
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"Up to now, our analysis has focused on the events of the lockdown of Wuhan -the epicenter of the Novel Coronavirus outbreak, it would also be interesting to study the impact of lockdowns and/or the social distancing measures in the destination cities in reducing and containing the spread of virus"
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"(2020) point out that travel restrictions to and from Mainland China impact the global pandemic of the COVID-19 only if transmission within the community is simultaneously reduced by 50% or more, which suggests that social distancing at the destination cities is crucial in preventing the possibly asymptomatic transmission from the source city"
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"Moreover, quantifying the effect of social distancing on virus transmission is especially relevant to the stage of pre-epidemic community spread when a person who is not known to have traveled to affected countries, or to have had contact with an infected person becomes infected."
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"We interpret the human mobility restrictions in the destination cities as an enhanced social distancing policy, because the ""lockdown"" rules in the destination cities are not as strict as those implemented in Wuhan"
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"If enhanced social distancing that comes from the ""lockdown policies"" imposed at the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei is effective in reducing the spread of the virus from population flows from the epicenter of the virus, then we expect that γ 1κ and γ 2κ to be smaller than β 1κ and β 2κ , respectively"
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,These results suggest that the enhanced social distancing policies in the destination cities are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the source cities of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"This in turn implies that population inflows from the epicenter contribute to the spread of infection in the destination cities only before the social distancing measures are applied; it appears that after implementing their various control measures, cities adopting an extended lockdown can flatten the upward trajectory of the virus."
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"Using counterfactual simulations with these estimates, we find that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities"
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,We also find evidence that imposing enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei province is effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities elsewhere.
34580,Human Mobility Restrictions and the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China,"Enhanced social distancing in the destination cities, and, if an epicenter can be identified as was the case for the city of Wuhan in China, a lockdown, can play crucial roles in ""flattening"" the daily infection cases curve, giving the stressed medical system a chance to regroup and deal with the onslaught of new infection cases"

34587,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","That said, social distancing, even without reducing overall outbreak size, has the added benefit of delaying the epidemic peak, which gains time that can be used to build health system capacity and identify therapies and vaccines."
34587,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","In contrast to fixed-duration social distancing, we find that dynamic social distancing, with interventions turned on and off as needed, based on ICU capacity crossing a given threshold, represents a more effective, and likely more palatable, control strategy"
34587,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","Social distancing can be relaxed, but this inevitably results in resurgent disease in the population, requiring reinstatement"

34674,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"These correspond approximately to the control measures modelled by Ferguson et al (2020) of: (i) closing schools and universities (Rc=2.3); (ii) case isolation (Rc=2); (iii) case isolation and household quarantine (Rc=1.75); (iv) case isolation, household quarantine, and population-wide social distancing (Rc=1.3); and (v) case isolation, household quarantine, population-wide social distancing, and closing schools and universities (Rc=1.2)"
34674,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"Mitigation strategies were simulated as a combination of a low level of control (case isolation and household quarantine, reducing Rc to 1.75) with periods of high control as required to try and keep the number of cases under hospital capacity"
34674,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"This is comparable to the scenario tested by Ferguson et al (2020) , where weak control means Rc=1.75 (representing case isolation and household quarantine in the Ferguson et al (2020) model) and strong control means Rc=0.75 (representing the above measures plus populationwide social distancing in Ferguson et al (2020))"

34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"As the number of infected people increases in a community, public health policies move away from containment of the outbreak to mitigation strategies such as social distancing and isolation, with considerable detrimental effects on public life and the economy"
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"The model coefficients are calibrated based on existing data, and the model is employed to investigate two main mitigation approaches, one relying on social distancing and one on more frequent infection testing"
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,Note that it is important to employ data from a period before measures like social distancing were taken
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,This means that the system can be stabilized by either reducing the infection rate (containment or social distancing) or by more frequent testing
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"The former can be enforced by mitigation policies such as social distancing, while the latter can be attained by mass testing of asymptomatic individuals."
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,In this section we investigate the effect of two different mitigation strategies: social distancing and mass testing
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,The first mitigation strategy tested with our model is social distancing

34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"In the logarithmic plot one can see that the number of infected persons remains constant during the social distancing phase (as expected when R 0 = 1), but the number of cases and deaths keeps increasing"
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"With some delay after social distancing is abandoned, the numbers raise exponentially until more than half of the population becomes immune"
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,After the social distancing phase there is a delay of approximately 200 days before the numbers climb exponentially until more than half of the initial population is immune
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"In both cases one obtains the same endemic state as in the base case, i.e., temporary social distancing only delays the main outbreak"
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"This demonstrates that mass testing would have a similar effect as social distancing, and provided effective testing methods become available, this approach has the important advantage that the world's economy would not come to a halt"
34706,Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic,"Like in the case of social distancing, unless one assumes that the virus can be defeated completely and globally, testing would have to be continued until an effective vaccine becomes widely available"

34775,COVID-19 Modelling: the Effects of Social Distancing,On one extreme we have perfect social distancing with R 0 = 0 but we also investigate the effect of R 0 = 0.5 and R = 0.75.
34775,COVID-19 Modelling: the Effects of Social Distancing,Day 55 is used for initiating social distancing since the simulations here showed 337 dead and 5486 sick consistent with reported numbers on 23 March 2020 when the United Kingdom initiated lockdown
34775,COVID-19 Modelling: the Effects of Social Distancing,In the case of perfect social distancing the mortality rate is only 0.04% (21474 dead) and the epidemic is resolved by day 90 with the number of people sick peaking on day 70.
34775,COVID-19 Modelling: the Effects of Social Distancing,In the case of a more relaxed social distancing with R 0 = 0.50 the mortality rate is 0.13% (79781 dead) without having the epidemic resolved by day 250 and with the number of people sick peaking on day 71
34775,COVID-19 Modelling: the Effects of Social Distancing,A somewhat stricter social distancing with R 0 = 0.25 would resolve the epidemic by day 189 and lead to 32998 dead.
34775,COVID-19 Modelling: the Effects of Social Distancing,"Finally, if the social distancing is relaxed to R 0 = 0.75 we observe a much later peak in the number of people sick on day 112 and also a much larger mortality rate of 0.55% (330964 dead)."

34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Social distancing, or practices which reduce the probability of contact between infected and non-infected people, has emerged as the primary tool for reducing the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.(1; 2; 3) As of March 2020, other methods for fighting infectious disease are mostly unavailable or ineffective due to the characteristics of this pathogen: (1) it is an emergent virus to which there is no pre-existing immunity, available vaccine, or proven treatment;"
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"(4) Broad public mandates for social distancing are also vital to help manage a key multiplier of COVID-19 fatality rates: a substantial fraction of patients require lengthy (on average 8 bed days) intensive care unit (ICU) support to survive acute respiratory distress, and uncontrolled spread of the disease is expected to generate at its peak far greater demand for ICU care than existing capacity can meet.(5; 2; 6) Public health experts have pleaded with officials to quickly mandate social distancing to flatten the curve of coronavirus infections -that is, reduce the peak caseload -before exponential case growth leads to hundreds of thousands or millions of deaths"
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"The most significant policy decisions of this kindboth in terms of their potential to mitigate the epidemic and their economic consequences -are mandates for social distancing through restrictions on public gatherings; closure or restriction of schools, restaurants, and other non-essential businesses; and orders for the public to stay at home"
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Even if the true doubling time of infections prior to social distancing is as long as a week, delaying these measures just three days would, all else equal, raise the eventual peak number of cases by more than 30%, potentially increasing total deaths by thousands or more in a given state."

34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"(14) More generally, states with more limited economic resources are likely far less able to weather the deprivations caused by economic shutdowns, or to expand social insurance protections during mandated social distancing, and thus may be considerably more reluctant to take these steps."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,But the greatest barrier to swift social distancing measures seems political
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"And as social distancing measures have spread, Republican leaders, including Trump, have been more vocal in their desire to quickly rollback these measures to restore the economy."

34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"The seemingly quicker action of pandemic politics · Adolph, Amano, Bang-Jensen, Fullman & Wilkerson ""blue states"" could simply be a result of the coronavirus first emerging in cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and New York, as well as in states better able to endure prolonged social distancing mandates"
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"To investigate why some states acted quickly to implement social distancing while others took longer, we identified five critical areas of social distancing policy -recommendations and restrictions against public gatherings, mandatory school closures, restrictions on the normal operation of restaurants, closure of non-essential businesses, and stay-at-home orders -and collected the dates each state first announced such measures"
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,Our findings are unambiguous: political variables are the strongest predictor of the early adoption of social distancing policies
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"All else equal, states with Republican governors and Republican electorates delayed each social distancing measure by an average of 2.70 days (95% CI: 2.49 to 2.88), a far larger effect than any other factor, including state income per capita, the percentage of neighboring states with mandates, or even confirmed cases in each state."

34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"In general, states typically started social distancing through recommendations or restrictions on public gatherings, then turned to restrictions on schools 2 We include recommendations in this category for two reasons: first, this was often the first action states took, and early actors did not always revisit these policies with a restrictive mandate; second, the target of these measures was typically large events that would be unlikely to maintain viable attendance under the cloud of a state recommendation to cancel events."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"The final plot on the bottom right highlights the rapid growth in states enacting multiple social distancing measures, as well as the presence of a substantial number of laggard states still lacking most social distancing policies as late as 23 March 2020."

34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"3 We model the likelihood that a state will implement each social distancing policy as a function of time (measured in days) with a pooled, stratified Cox proportional hazards model, often referred to as the Wei-Lin-Weissfeld marginal model"
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"(22) In our application, this approach allows us to examine the common factors affecting implementation of social distancing across states by 1) pooling the five social distancing measures shown in Figure 1 in a single model, (2) stratifying baseline hazards across the five policy types to allow for varying underlying tendencies to adopt some policies more quickly than others, and (3) clustering standard errors by state."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"As usual, the Cox model allows us to estimate a baseline hazard rate, which shifts in proportion to changes in covariates, and accommodates right-censored cases (states that have not yet adopted a given social distancing measure at the end of the study period)"
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"The baseline hazard rate also captures any purely national trends, such as the common tendency of states to adopt social distancing policies as national deaths climb or public awareness of COVID-19 increases, while leaving cross-state variation to be explained by covariates."

34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"We review the determinants of delays in state-level COVID-19 social distancing measures in order of substantive impact, quantifying the impact of each factor in two ways"
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"First, we show the degree to which each factor -such as governors' partisanship, the presence of Trump voters, or actions by neighboring states -reduces the chance a state acts to impose a new social distancing mandate on a given date (Figure 2 ; see Appendix for tabular results)"
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"That is, we might ask: if every state had a Republican governor, how many days later would they have implemented each social distancing measure than if every state had a Democratic governor"
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,Republican-leaning states are slower to adopt social distancing policies
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"At any given time within the study period, Republican governors were 42.2% (95% CI: 13.5 to 63.2) less likely to mandate social distancing than their Democratic counterparts"

34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"At the same time, holding constant the Governor's party affiliation, states with more Trump voters were less likely to adopt social distancing"

34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"5 This is, from a public health perspective, a fairly reasonable result: early implementation of social distancing is likely to be far more effective, so pro-active governors may have realized there was little sense in waiting for a certain threshold of cases to act, especially given delays and failures in testing."

33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Aggregating across all individuals and under the optimistic assumption that all the contact tracing can be performed rapidly, we expect contact tracing to reduce the basic reproductive ratio from 3.11 to 0.21 -enabling the outbreak to be contained (figure 2)."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Rapid and effective contact tracing can therefore be highly effective in the early control of COVID-19, but places substantial demands on the local public-health authorities"

33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Given the strong biasing of transmission towards long-duration contacts, the impact of varying initial reproductive ratio is less extreme than might be expected; it is only for the highest values of initial reproductive ratio simulated (>9.8) that contact tracing fails to find more than one case such that infection can escape."

33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Surprisingly, small changes to the reproductive ratio, within the bounds estimated from early data ( Figure 4) or even changes to the distribution of infectivity, are predicted to have a relatively modest impact of the success of contact tracing illustrating the robustness of this control measure."
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,Our model has addressed the simple and optimistic question of whether contact tracing is sufficient to identify secondary infections
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,For contact tracing to be an effective public health measure requires secondary cases to be discovered before they become infectious; hence the time from the primary case becoming infectious to the tracing of their contacts needs to be shorter than the incubation period
33843,The Efficacy of Contact Tracing for the Containment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,"Therefore, while contact tracing has the potential to control COVID-19 (and other close-contact pathogens) the ultimate success relies on the speed and efficacy with which suspect contacts can be contained."

36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"16 In scenarios in which the delay from onset to isolation was long, similar to the delays in the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan, the same contact tracing success of 80% achieved a probability of containing an outbreak of less than 40%"
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"This type of transmission would make effective contact tracing challenging, and good respiratory and hand hygiene would be crucial to reduce this route of transmission, coupled with environmental decontamination in health-care settings"
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"We simplified our model to determine the effect of contact tracing and isolation on the control of outbreaks under different scenarios of transmission; however, as more data becomes available, the model can be updated or tailored to particular public health contexts"
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"The robustness of control measures is likely to be affected both by differences in transmission between countries, but also by the concurrent number of cases that require contact tracing in each scenario"
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"Practically, there is likely to be an upper bound on the number of cases that can be traced, which might vary by country, and case isolation is likely to be imperfect"
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"15, 18 Our analysis expands on this work by including infectiousness before the onset of symptoms, case isolation, explicit modelling of case incubation periods, and time to infectiousness"
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"If contact tracing included testing of non-symptomatic contacts, those contacts could be quarantined without symptoms, which would decrease transmission in the model"
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"Our study indicates that in most plausible outbreak scenarios, case isolation and contact tracing alone is insufficient to control outbreaks, and that in some scenarios even near perfect contact tracing will still be insufficient, and further interventions would be required to achieve control"
36693,Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"Rapid and effective contact tracing can reduce the initial number of cases, which would make the outbreak easier to control overall"
