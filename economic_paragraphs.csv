1892,Chapter 3 Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Poultry: Molecular Epidemiology and Factors Leading to the Emergence and Reemergence of Novel Strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus that causes an acute and highly contagious disease in chickens. The virus can cause substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. It can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause nephritis (Cavanagh, 1997) . IBV is the prototype species of the Coronavirus family, Gamma coronavirus genus, classified in the order Nidovirales, and it is the type species of the genus coronavirus of the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Cook et al., 2012) . Infectious bronchitis (IB) was first observed by Schalk and Hawn (1931) in North Dakota in the United States in 2-to 3week-old chickens. However, the nature of the infectious agent was not determined at that time and was assumed that IB was mainly a disease of young chickens. Hence, the disease was named ""infectious bronchitis of young chicks."" Five years later, it was demonstrated that the causative agent of this disease is a virus, which was named IBV (Beach and Schalm, 1936) . Since that initial discovery, many different serotypes, defined by neutralizing antibodies, and genetic types, based on the deduced amino acid sequence (from the nucleic acid sequence) of the spike gene, have been described around the world (El-Houadfi et al., 1986; Jackwood et al., 1997) ."
1892,Chapter 3 Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Poultry: Molecular Epidemiology and Factors Leading to the Emergence and Reemergence of Novel Strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"For logistics and economic reasons, some commercially available live attenuated IBV vaccines have been combined with other virus vaccines such as those against Newcastle disease virus, Marek's disease virus, and infectious bursal disease virus. However, it is not clear whether the combination may influence immune response to the combined antigen (Vagnozzi et al., 2010) , and if excess IBV component is present, IBV may interfere with other virus response such as NDV response (Thornton and Muskett, 1975) ."
2681,Protective effects of hypericin against infectious bronchitis virus induced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species in chicken embryo kidney cells,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the Coronaviridae family (Cook et al., 2012) , causes mild-to-acute respiratory disease in chickens (Benyeda et al., 2009; Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019) . IBV infects chickens via the respiratory tract, from which it can spread to other epithelial tissues. Therefore, IBV not only injures the respiratory tract, but also causes damage to the digestive system and urogenital system, such as the proventriculus, kidney, ovary, and oviduct, resulting in respiratory disease, interstitial nephritis, and dysplasia of the oviduct (Zhong et al., 2016) . IBV has led to severe economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. It has been demonstrated that IBV not only causes direct loss due to high mortality, secondary bac-terial infection, poor meat production, and egg quality, but also indirect losses arises from increasing drug costs and vaccination in IBV prevention (Liang et al., 2019) ."
4174,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China,"Data were analyzed with SPSS Version 22.0. An analysis of descriptive statistics was conducted to illustrate the demographic and other selected characteristics of the respondents. A univariate analysis (Nonparametric test) was used to explore the significant associations between sample characteristics and the anxiety level during the COVID-19 epidemic (Abdellatif et al., 2020) . Statistically significant variables were screened and included in multivariate logistic regression analyses. The estimates of the strengths of associations were demonstrated by the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Spearman's correlation coefficient, r, was used to evaluate the association between COVID-19-related stressors, including economic and daily-life related stressors, as well as stressors related to delays in academic activities, and anxiety level. A two-tailed p < .05 was considered statistically significant."
4174,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China,"The results of the correlation analysis are shown in Table 4 . Worry about the economic influences of the epidemic were positively related to the levels of anxiety in college students (r = .327, P < .001). Moreover, worry about academic delays (r = .315, P < .001) and the influence of the epidemic on daily-life (r = .316, P < .001) were also moderately and positively correlated with the level of anxiety. In addition, the results suggested a negative association between social support and anxiety symptoms of college students during the COVID-19 outbreak. (r = -.151, P < .001). Table 4 Correlation analysis between the COVID-19-related stressors and college students' anxiety when facing the epidemic "
4174,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China,"Multivariate Logistic regression analysis suggested that living in urban areas, in contrast to rural areas, was conducive to reducing the anxiety of college students. This might be explained by the imbalance of economic, cultural, and educational resources between urban and rural areas. The urban economy is relatively prosperous and provides citizens with better material security (Shigemura et al., 2020) . Similarly, the sanitary conditions in cities are better than in towns and villages, which decreases the chances of surviving the virus. Cities also have excellent educational resources, and they have made great efforts to publicize knowledge on how to prevent the epidemic, which attracts attention to the measures taken to stop the epidemic . The stability of family income was also was a significant factor in students' experienced anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis, which could be explained by increased psychological and economic pressure (Liu, 2013) . Living with parents was another favorable factor against feeling anxious. Previous studies have indicated that the risk factors associated with emotional and anxiety disorders in adults include the death of parents in childhood, not living with parents, and parents' psychological problems and mental illnesses (Woodgate et al.,2020; Gentili et al., 2020) , which are consistent with the results of this study. Relatives or acquaintances being infected with COVID-19 was an independent risk factor in college students' anxiety about the epidemic, which might be related to the high contagiousness of the new coronavirus pneumonia (World Health Organization, 2020; Song et al., 2019) . Consistent with our hypothesis, the COVID-19-related stressors, which include economic stressors, effects on daily-life, and academic delays, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms of Chinese college students during the epidemic. Similar studies (Kernan, 2019) have indicated that in addition to the national health situation, the epidemic will also have a significant impact on the economy of the country and individuals. Because of the outbreak, some families will lose their source of income, and students might feel anxious about paying their tuition fees (Peng et al., 2012) . In China, the government took measures, including travel warnings and bans, and extending the national holidays to control the outbreak, which inevitably disrupted routine life and resulted in anxiety. In the mainland China and Hong Kong, all primary and secondary schools were closed, and universities were either postponing classes until March 2020 or were using distant/remote learning methods (Kwok et al., 2020) . These measures undoubtedly have a specific impact on the education and the growth of students. Finally, social support was negatively correlated with the anxiety of college students, which is consistent with previous findings (Thompson et al., 2016; . Social support not only reduces the psychological pressure during the epidemics but also changes the attitude regarding social support and help-seeking methods. This result suggests that effective and robust social support is necessary during public health emergencies (Bai et al., 2005) ."
4174,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China,"About 24.9% of college students have experienced anxiety because of this COVID-19 outbreak. Living in urban areas, living with parents, having a steady family income were protective factors for college students against experienced anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, having a relative or an acquaintance infected with COVID-19 was an independent risk factor for experienced anxiety. The COVID-19-related stressors that included economic stressors, effects on daily-life, and academic delays were positively associated with the level of anxiety symptoms of Chinese college students during the epidemic, whereas social support was negatively correlated with their anxiety."
7839,Immunohistochemical and molecular detection of natural cases of bovine rotavirus and coronavirus infection causing enteritis in dairy calves,"Livestock sector in India plays a pivotal role in supporting the livelihood of rural masses. This sector alone contributes 4.11% of the total GDP. Economics of any livestock farm dependent on the health of its neonates, which are the future herd [1] . Despite the fact, neonatal calves are abysmally cared, with the result significant morbidity and mortality of these calves incurred huge economic consequences. Amongst various causes, the calf diarrhoea (enteritis) is a commonly reported disease worldwide in cattle. Diarrhoea is a multi-factorial disease, which accounts for 57% of mortality in < 1 month old calves [2] . In diarrhoeic calves, although co-infection observed frequently, but at times a single etiology can also be the cause in some cases. Major enteric viral pathogens responsible for calf diarrhoea are mainly Rotavirus and Coronavirus. Of late, newer emerging enteric pathogens such as Torovirus, Norovirus, Nebovirus, Enterovirus, Calcivirus and Parvovirus have also been added to the list of diarrhoea causing agents [3] . Co-infection with more than one pathogen is more frequent and often worsens the symptoms. The tetrad of Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Cryptosporidium, and Escherichia coli accounts for 75-95% of infection in neonatal calves worldwide, of which especially rotavirus and coronavirus account for 27-36% and 20-26% infections, respectively [4] [5] [6] [7] . Among all pathogens, rotaviruses are the leading cause of calf diarrhoea, and coronaviruses are a major contributor to it [4, 5, 8, 9] . The coronavirus infect both small intestine and large intestine to cause severe disease [10] . In calves, group A rotavirus and coronavirus, either single or in combination, are predominately associated with neonatal (mostly up to 5-15 day old) diarrhoea [11] [12] . The diagnosis of diarrhoea (enteritis) cases is cumbersome due to non specific nature of clinical signs/lesions, interaction of polymicrobial agents and involvement of intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors [13] ."
7841,Gga-miR-30d regulates infectious bronchitis virus infection by targeting USP47 in HD11 cells,"Infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), is a highly contagious viral disease of the chicken [1] . Since IB was first described by Schalk and Hawn in USA in 1931 [2] , it has developed into one of the foremost causes of economic loss in the poultry industry, affecting the performance of both meat-type and egglaying chickens. IBV is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, classified taxonomically as a member of genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae [3] . Initially, this pathogen replicated primarily in the respiratory tract, causing a highly contagious respiratory disease characterized by nasal discharge, snicking, rales, and tracheal ciliostasis in chickens, but later reports demonstrated that it also replicated in many other epithelial surfaces, including enteric surfaces, oviducts, and kidneys [4] . Although vaccination is the most reliable approach to control IBV, the high mutation rate and recombination events differentiate IBV into numerous genotypes and serotypes, causing poor cross-protection of vaccines [5] . Therefore, it is urgent to apply new technologies and methods to control IBV."
8080,SARS-CoV-2: fear versus data,"In comparison, the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in European or American developed countries of a comparable economic level is 1.3% (Table 3 ). If the extrapolation of deaths in AP-HM hospitals is correct, in metropolitan France, this would represent 543/0.8 * 100 = 67 875 cases of patients hospitalized with a respiratory infection with common coronaviruses in 2 months, which is almost as many cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. In fact, mortality from respiratory infections is extremely dependent on the quality of care and access to care, and severe forms have a better prognosis in countries with superior medical infrastructures. Under these conditions, there does not seem to be a significant difference between the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in OECD countries and that of common coronaviruses (χ 2 test, P=0.11). Of course, the major flaw in this study is that the percentage of deaths attributable to the virus is not determined, but this is the case for all studies reporting respiratory virus infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, viral infections are ecosystem infections where the outcome depends on the inoculums and the surrounding microbiota [26] . Thus, certain bacteria seem to be associated with symptomatic manifestations, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, which are known to cause an excess of mortality due to secondary infection. Finally, seasonality, geographic location, heat and humidity are co-factors, as are age, gender and underlying pathologies. Under these conditions, and all other things being equal, SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be described as being statistically more severe than infection with other coronaviruses in common circulation."
22177,Prevalence of Pathogens Related to Bovine Respiratory Disease Before and After Transportation in Beef Steers: Preliminary Results,"Our data should be considered preliminary because this study was limited by a number of factors. Firstly, due to the small number of events (three shipments, 112 samples) the logistic model was likely to suffer from small-sample bias. Secondly, the effects of other factors, such as age of the animals, driver, month, the number of farms per transport, climate conditions, space allowance and mingling were not considered, consequently, our results are valid only for the tested type of journey and animals. It is indeed well known that management conditions of the transport, distance travelled, season and geographic area of origin, are crucial elements in order to define the risk profile of developing BRD. Thirdly, the prevalence of the pathogens at the farms of origin and the number of farms per each shipment was not determined. This gap was due to the fact that the animals collected at the assembly point arrived from different local farms, and it was not possible to sample animals over there and we had no access to the documentation reporting the origin of each animal. However, sampling before loading provides a partial indication of the animal's health status. Lastly, a great limitation of the study is that it was not possible to split the effects of the stress due to transport from stress due to the adaptation to a new farm and to document how those stressors affect the immune system of the animals. It has been found that potential causes for BRD onset include stress associated with transport, adaptation to feed, the new social hierarchy, and viral exposure [1, 2] . It is well known that these stressors affect respiratory immunity, response to infection, bacterial growth, viral replication and the tissue repair process, and are responsible for an increase in cortisol release and a decrease in leukocyte numbers [20, 21] . Consequently, it has been suggested that, to reduce the economic cost of the disease, it may be more effective to focus on the host than the pathogens [1, 22] . Unfortunately, in this pilot study it was not possible to determine stress or other immunology biomarkers, thus further studies are needed to explain other possible causes of the increase in the prevalence of BRD pathogens in the nasal microbiome of beef steers after travelling. Our results need, therefore, to be confirmed in a larger dataset, including more events and evaluating the effects of multiple factors using multivariate regression analysis to provide useful guidelines to prevent the performance losses and poor welfare associated with BRD. Notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations, this preliminary study increased our knowledge of the prevalence of BRD in beef steers."
22338,"PEDV enters cells through clathrin-, caveolae-, and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis and traffics via the endo-/lysosome pathway","As a type of alphacoronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused enormous economic loss to the global pork industry, especially after the emergence of highly pathogenic PEDV variant strains in 2010. PEDV was first reported in 1971 in the UK [1] , and afterward was also discovered in Europe and Asia [2] [3] [4] [5] . Although PEDV has persisted in Asian swine-producing countries, it does not attract enough global attention. After October 2010, severe PED outbreaks occurred even in Chinese pig farms that were already vaccinated with CV777inactivated or live-attenuated vaccines [2, [6] [7] [8] . In 2013, the first PEDV outbreak occurred in the US and rapidly spread across the entire country [9] . Molecular epidemiological results show the genetic differences between classical (GI subtype) and new PEDV variant strains (GII subtype) [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9] . PEDV is presently recognized worldwide due to dramatic changes observed in its epidemic character, pathogenic properties, and gene drift [10] . Studies focused on its pathogenesis [11, 12] , immune evasion [13] and developing effective vaccines [14, 15] are progressing."
22550,Genomic Characterization and Phylogenetic Classification of Bovine Coronaviruses Through Whole Genome Sequence Analysis,"Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) causes neonatal calf diarrhea, winter dysentery in adult cattle, and respiratory tract disorders in cattle of all age groups [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . BCoV infections in herds lead to a reduction in milk production, deterioration of health, and deaths of young animals, resulting in severe economic losses [6, 7] . In general, there are two different types (enteric and respiratory) of BCoVs based on disease symptoms. Although some previous reports have suggested that several candidate amino acids may contribute to the differences between the two disease types, it still remains unclear [8] [9] [10] ."
25037,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak: a quick online cross-sectional survey","The correct answer rates of the 12 questions on the COVID-19 knowledge questionnaire were 70.2-98.6% (Table 1 ). The mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 10.8 (SD: 1.6, range: 0-12), suggesting an overall 90% (10.8/12*100) correct rate on this knowledge test. Knowledge scores significantly differed across genders, age-groups, categories of marital status, education levels, and residence places (P<0.001) ( Table 2 ). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that male gender (vs. female, β: -0.284, P<0.001), age-group of 16-29 years (vs. 30-49 years, β: -0.302, P<0.001), marital status of never-married (vs. married, β: -0.215, P<0.001), education of bachelor's degree or lower (vs. master degree and above, β: -0.191 ~ -1.346, P<0.001), and occupations of unemployment (β: -0.158, P=0.040) and students (β: -0.234, P<0.001) (vs. mental labor) were significantly associated with lower knowledge score (Table 3) . The majority of the respondents agreed that COVID-19 will finally be successfully controlled (90.8%). Rates of reporting ""disagree"" and ""I don't know"" were 1.9% and 7.3%, respectively. The attitude towards the final success in controlling COVID-19 significantly differed across genders, education levels, occupation categories, and residence places (P<0.05). In additions, respondents reporting ""disagree"" and ""I don't know"" had significantly lower knowledge scores than those reporting ""agree"" (P<0.001) ( .001) were significantly associated with the answer of ""I don't know"" on A1 (Table 5) ."
25037,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak: a quick online cross-sectional survey","The strength of this study lies in its large sample recruited during a critical period, the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Nevertheless, compared to the most recent national population statistics of China [21], our sample was obviously over-representative of women, well-educated people, and people engaging in mental labor. Given the significant associations between these demographic variables and KAP towards COVID-19 revealed in this study, we may have overestimated knowledge and rates of preventive practices and underestimated rates of positive attitudes towards COVID-19 of Chinese residents. Considering that educational attainment and occupation are often used as proxy measures of socioeconomic status [22] , strictly speaking, our findings can only be generalized to Chinese populations of a relatively high socioeconomic status, particularly women."
25037,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak: a quick online cross-sectional survey","In summary, our findings suggest that Chinese residents of a relatively high level of socioeconomic status, in particular women, have had good knowledge, optimistic attitudes, and appropriate practices towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, good COVID-19 knowledge is associated with optimistic attitudes and appropriate practices towards COVID-19, suggesting that health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for encouraging an optimistic attitudes and maintaining safe practices. Hopefully, under the combined efforts of Chinese authorities and all Chinese residents, China surely will win the battle against COVID-19 in the near future. Due to the limitation in representativeness of the sample, more studies are warranted to investigate the KAP towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents of a low socioeconomic status."
33839,Assessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19),"Although the COVID-19 epidemic was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO), the WHO specifically called upon member states to not restrict the freedom of movement of persons as a result of the epidemic [21] . However, member states did not adhere to this recommendation and have varyingly restricted the free movement of people from China [22] . Such restrictions were most drastic in China, where some cities were put on complete lockdown [22] . These political decisions regarding movement restrictions must balance the expected epidemiological impact with predicted economic burden-the latter of which we did not examine. While securing a few days delay to epidemic spread in China would secure time for healthcare systems in Chinese cities that have not yet been affected to prepare for the appearance of case-patients [20] , the impact of such a delay outside China is not substantial enough to accomplish meaningful prevention, such as the development, manufacturing, and distribution of a vaccine."
33863,Risk map of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China: proportionate control is needed,"We evaluated the risk of 2019-nCoV outbreak in cities and regions across China and suggested four levels of risk, highlighting that the cities with low risk should return to the normal status in order to avoid unnecessary economic loss."
33863,Risk map of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China: proportionate control is needed,"The risk level of cities was classified using five variables, whereas the variables had different weights in the model, quantified by importance indices in random forest model [11] (Fig. 4) . Similarly, GDP is an index of economic activities, which links to human flow and virus transmission rate."
33882,Functional pangenome analysis suggests inhibition of the protein E as a readily available therapy for COVID-2019,"The current epidemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a rising global health emergency (WHO https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) with disruptive health, social and economic repercussions. Three major actions, confinement, detection and therapy are required to contain this pandemic. Detection and therapy can be guided by virus sequence data, which was first made available in 17 December, 2019 at gsaid.org, soon after detection of the first cases. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data are a pivotal resource on its own, but can gain greater value when embedded within those of other Betacoronavirus, allowing a comparative pangenomic analysis. This approach can help identify the core genome of Betacoronaviruses and extract accessory genomic features shared by a subset of these viruses or unique to SARS-CoV-2. Whereas core genomic features are required for the virus to be functional, accessory features are candidates to provide insights into the drivers of the unique capacities of SARS-CoV-2 explaining its spread and virulence. Genome annotation and structural modelling can then be used to assess the possible functions of these accessory features and guide approaches to detection and treatment."
33889,Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China,"An initial exponential growth of confirmed cases is generically expected for an uncontrolled outbreak and in most cases mitigated with a time delay by effective containment strategies and policies that reduce transmission and effective reproduction of the virus, commonly yielding a saturation in the cumulative case count and an exponential decay in the number of new infections. Although in Hubei the number of cases was observed to grow exponentially in early January [9] , the * bfmaier@physik.hu-berlin.de subsequent rise followed a sub-exponential, super-linear, algebraic scaling law t µ with an exponent µ = 2.3 (between Jan. 24th and Feb. 9th), cf. Fig. 1A . For the majority of the affected Chinese provinces of Mainland China, however, this type of algebraic rise occured from the beginning, lacking an initial exponential growth altogether. Surprisingly, the exponent µ does not vary substantially with a typical value of µ = 2.1 ± 0.3 for the confirmed case curves in other substantially affected provinces (confirmed case counts larger than 500 on Feb. 12th), despite geographical, socio-economical differences, differences in containment strategies, and heterogeneties that may have variable impacts on how the local epidemic unfolds, cf. Fig. 1B and C."
33987,Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation,"Our analysis is based on the complete ""tracking and recording"" information of imported cases and local cases detected in the province of Shaanxi province [7] , as this allows us to generate a data set that includes the time series of daily latent, infected and hospitalized cases. Since the outbreak scale in the Province of Shanxi was relatively small and this is subject to stochasticity in both case importation and local cases generated by the importation and since the Provincial data has detailed information on symptom onset and serial intervals, we adopt a method developed by Nishiura and Chowell [15, 16] to estimate the effective reproduction number, and we revise some of our early deterministic models to a novel discrete stochastic model to address the key issues relevant to preventing a secondary outbreak of COVID-19 in other provinces except for Hubei, due to the anticipated gradually relaxing of travel restriction and returning to normal social and economic activities."

Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World."
34099,Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China,"is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20029843 doi: medRxiv preprint Local governments across China encouraged and supported routine screening and quarantine of travellers from Hubei Province in an attempt to detect COVID-19 infections as early as possible. In Wuhan, where the largest number of infected people live, residents were required to measure and report ther temperature daily to confirm their onset, and those with mild and asymptomatic infections were also quarantined in ""Fang Cang"" hospitals, which are public spaces such as stadiums and conference centres that have been repurposed for medical care. 11 The average interval from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation has dropped from 12 days in the early stages of the outbreak to 3 days in early February, highlighting how the efficiency of disease detection and diagnosis has greatly improved. 15, 16 Third, inner-city travel and contact restrictions were implemented to reduce the risk of community transmission. This involved limiting individual social contact, using personal hygiene and protective measures when people needed to move in public, and increasing the physical distance between those who have COVID-19 and those who do not. 11 As part of these social distancing policies, Chinese government encouraged people to stay at home as much as possible, cancelled or postponed large public events and mass gatherings, and closed libraries, museums, and workplaces. 17, 18 Additionally, to fully cover the suspected incubation period of COVID-19 spread before Wuhan's lockdown, the CNY and school holidays were also extended, with the holiday end date changed from January 30 to March 10 for Hubei province, and Feb 9 for many other provinces. [19] [20] [21] The implementation of these NPIs has coincided with the rapid decline in the number of new cases across China, albeit at high economic and social costs. 15, 16 On February 17, the State Council required localities to formulate differentiated county-level measures for precise containment of the COVID-19 outbreak and the restoration of socioeconomy affected by the outbreak. 22 The timing of implementing and lifting interventions is likely to have been and continue to be important, to take advantage of the window of opportunity to save lives and minimize the economic and social impact. 23, 24 The increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 outside China and establishment of secondary transmission in multiple places highlights its pandemic potential.

34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"The benefit from closing schools during an epidemic is to reduce transmission and new cases. Cauchemez et al. estimated that extended school closures in France could reduce H5N1 influenza cases by 13-17%. 2 Bayham et al. show that schools are likely places for transmission among US children. 3 However, Bayham et al. also show voluntary behavioral changes, without mandatory shutdowns, appeared to reduce cases of the 2009 H1N1 influenza on the order of 10-13%. In a systematic review, focused on influenza and school closures, Jackson et al. find some evidence that school closures are effective, but that the empirical evidence does not resolve how or when to close schools. 4 Furthermore, they find school closure mostly reduces infection in school children. Koh et al. do not find strong evidence that school closures prevent the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease. 5 Adda finds that while school closures do reduce incidence in France, the economic costs are large. 6 The benefits of school closure are often estimated relative to a baseline of no voluntary changes in behavior, but it is likely that the correct baseline for forcasting the school closure effect on COVID-19 includes other voluntary behavioral changes."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"The potential benefits of school closures must be balanced with the costs. Smith et al., Lempel, Epstein, and Hammond, and Adda analyze the economic impacts of school closures. 1, 6, 7 Schooling is one of the most important investments we make in our children's futures, and we do not have good estimates of how prolonged school closures influence drop-out rates and future earnings. This uncertainty makes a holistic assessment of tradeoffs challenging."
34204,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"Setting aside the economic costs and focusing on reducing mortality, school closures still create a tradeoff. Many healthcare workers must reduce time spent providing patient care, running diagnostic tests, and tracing contacts, and increase time caring for their own children. This tradeoff should not be ignored because the capacity to care for infected individuals and trace contacts directly influences the development of an epidemic, the survival of infected patients, and ultimately cummulative mortality from the pathogen."
34214,Effects of Chinese strategies for controlling the diffusion and deterioration of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in China,"COVID-19, a new and severe epidemic, has threatened public health and economic development in China [7] . As of March 6, 2020, the number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 has reached 100,000 worldwide, and some countries such as Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran are also suffering from the rapid spread of COVID-19 [4, 7, 8] . The need for greater attention and intervention strategies to curb the spread of COVID-19 around the world is of paramount importance."
34240,Generalized logistic growth modeling of the COVID-19 outbreak in 29 provinces in China and in the rest of the world,"However, for this forecast to come true, all European countries need to coordinate and fight together to avoid another major outbreak like in Italy. The situation in the United States is also at the very beginning stage, and may pose significant health and economic risks to the world in absence of serious measures."
34271,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"For infectious diseases, the number of infected people usually increases first before reaching a peak and then drops. This pattern implies that for a linear equation of new cases on the number of cases in the past, the unobserved determinants of new infections are serially correlated. The unobserved determinants of new cases may be serially correlated, also because they measure persistent factors, such as people's habit and government policy. Serial correlations in errors give rise to correlations between the lagged number of cases and the error term, and ordinary least square (OLS) estimator may be biased. Combining insights in Adda (2016) and the existing knowledge of the incubation period of COVID-19, we construct instrumental variables for the number of new COVID-19 cases in the preceding two weeks. Weather characteristics in the previous third and fourth weeks do not directly affect today's number of new COVID-19 cases after controlling for the number of new COVID-19 cases and weather conditions in the preceding first and second weeks. Therefore, our estimated impacts have causal interpretations. We use the Lasso method to select instrumental variables among eleven weather characteristics that have the highest predictive power for the average number of new confirmed cases during each of the past two weeks. Furthermore, we examine the moderator effects of socioeconomic factors on the transmission of COVID-19 in China, which include population flow out of Wuhan, the distance between cities, GDP per capita, number of doctors, and contemporaneous weather characteristics. We focus on the effect of population flows from the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak, because data on real time travel between cities have recently become available and we examine whether it can explain the disease spread, and that Wuhan is a major city and a transportation hub with significant population movements."
34271,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"We find that the stringent quarantine and public health measures imposed in late January significantly decreased the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the spread of the virus had been contained in China. While many socioeconomic factors moderate the spread of the virus, the actual population flow from the source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. Our analysis contributes to the existing literature in two aspects. First, our analysis is connected to the economics and epidemiologic literature on the influencing factors of and ways of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Existing studies find that reductions in interpersonal contact from holiday school closings (Adda, 2016) , reactive school closure (Litvinova et al., 2019) , public transportation strikes (Godzinski and Suarez Castillo, 2019) , strategic targeting of travelers from high-incidence locations (Milusheva, 2017) , and paid sick leave to keep contagious workers at home (Barmby and Larguem, 2009, Pichler and Ziebarth, 2017) can reduce the prevalence of influenza."

34271,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"A main objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of various social and economic factors in mediating the transmission rates of the virus, which may help identify potential behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors for infections. For within city transmissions, we consider the mediating effect of population density, degree of economic development, number of doctors, and environmental factors such as temperature, wind and rain. To measure the spread of the virus from Wuhan, we include an estimate of the number of people traveling from Wuhan. The empirical model including these mediating variables is as follows,"

Most studies on the socioeconomic impacts of climate change have found that estimation results are insensitive to the choice of the cutoff distance (Zhang et al., 2017) . We also used other cutoff distances (e.g., 150km) for robustness checks, and the main results remain unchanged. These results are available upon request."
34271,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"We investigate the impacts of many social, economic and environmental variables in mediating the transmission rates (Eq. (3)). For own city transmissions, we consider the mediating effects of population density, per capita GDP, number of doctors, contemporaneous temperature, wind speed and precipitation. For between-city transmissions, we consider the mediating effects of distance, density difference and per capita GDP difference. We also include a measure of population flows from Wuhan. Table 6 reports the estimation results of the IV regressions using the first half sample, and Table 7 reports the estimates for the second half sample."
34271,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"Our main conclusions still hold with these mediating factors included. The effects of past infections are much smaller in the second half sample, suggesting that the virus outbreak has been contained. For the between-city transmissions, population flow from Wuhan poses a risk for new infections in other cities, with one week lag in the first half sample, and with two week lag in the second half sample. The effects are robust with the inclusion of other measures of proximity, such as those based on geography and economic similarity. Table 8 shows variables that affect transmissions within cities and whose coefficients are statistically significant at 0.1. In order to help compare across variables, we compute the changes in the variables needed in order for the coefficient of past infections on current cases to be reduced by 1. The effects of the environmental factors and population density are mixed. We also observe that the transmission rate is lower in cities with more doctors. Cities with higher per capita GDP have higher transmission rates, which may be due to more social interactions as a result of more economic activity 17 . However, until clearer mechanisms are identified and tested, this should be interpreted with caution."
34279,Impact of the contact and exclusion rates on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic,"We think that the more realistic scenarios are these in which the contact rate varies over time. In early phase of the epidemic, the contact rate may be reduced only by forcing people to stay at home; in the latter phase, when the number of daily cases exceeds a threshold, people isolate themselves to reduce the risk. In such scenario the number of daily new cases reaches peak proportional to an assumed ""fear"" threshold and then slowly decreases due to the decreasing fraction of susceptible individuals. Such scenario seems more realistic and, although devastating for both the economy and social life, grants time to develop and administer vaccine. Historical data on 1918-1919 H1N1 influenza pandemic suggest also that this ""fear"" threshold may not be constant in time, because people suffering from prolonged quarantine may tend to accept higher risk. When this ""negligence"" effect is included, one may obtain trajectories for which fast growth is followed by a plateau and then relatively fast decrease of daily cases. A bit surprisingly, this scenario, although not resulting from centrally imposed preventive policies, may be the most plausible non-containment scenario balancing health and economic costs."

Our analyses suggest a positive timelagged association between human migration and the incidence of COVID-19. We identified 3 distinct clusters of provinces based on the timing and strength of associations: 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lagged association, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Provinces that are closer to Wuhan and have more passenger influx from Wuhan experienced a more prolonged impact from migration.

34457,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"In this study, we examine the economic feasibility of developing and supporting a portfolio of vaccines for the world's most threatening emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) as determined by scientific experts, drawing from the list of targets made by the recently launched global initiative, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) (1) (2) (3) . Our portfolio is composed of the 141 preclinical assets identified by Gouglas et al. to be targeting the priority diseases."
34457,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"Uncontrolled outbreaks of EIDs, defined as infections that have ""recently appeared within a population, or those whose incidence or geographic range is rapidly increasing or threatens to increase in the near future"" (5) , have the potential to devastate populations globally, both in terms of lives lost and economic value destroyed. Notable recent outbreaks of EIDs include the 1998 Nipah outbreak in Malaysia, the 2003 SARS outbreak in China, and the 2014 Ebola outbreak. In addition to the thousands of lives lost, the economic costs of these outbreaks are estimated as $671 million, $40 billion, and $2.2 billion, respectively (5) (6) (7) (8) ."
34457,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"As the world becomes more globalized, urbanized, and exposed to the effects of climate change, the danger of infectious diseases has become an even greater concern (9), as emerging and re-emerging strains become more diverse, and outbreaks become more frequent. While distinct from the emerging infectious diseases, influenza serves as the best example of the destruction that viruses with pandemic potential can inflict on the modern world. As a baseline, avian influenza outbreaks in the U.S. since late 2014 have caused economy-wide losses estimated at $3.3 billion domestically, and have significantly disrupted trade (10) . The 1918 influenza pandemic, however, is estimated to have infected 500 million people and killed 3-5% of the world's population. In 2006, Dr. Larry Brilliant stated that 90% of the epidemiologists in his confidence agreed that there would be a large influenza pandemic within two generations, in which 1 billion people would sicken, 165 million would die, and the global economy would lose $1 to $3 trillion (11) (see Supplementary Materials for further discussion). Controlling EIDs before they have the chance to reach comparable scale represents a significant opportunity to prevent similar loss. few economic incentives for manufacturers to develop preventative vaccines for EIDs, due to the high costs of R&D and the uncertain future demand. Even if protection against these emerging diseases were immediately achievable with existing technology, development costs are significant (12) , as they are for any pharmaceutical development program. Pronker et al. (13) estimate that it costs between $200-900 million for a new vaccine to be created. Failure to gain approval also poses a substantial risk, as successful passage through clinical trials only occurs 6-11% of the time (13, 14) . Regulatory challenges are particularly prominent in EID vaccine development, as viable candidates are rarely available for distribution during outbreaks, making safety and efficacy testing difficult. As a result, vaccine development for EIDs has been reactive and technologically conservative (15) ."
34457,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"Of course, this subscription model considers only the development cost of vaccines. Once developed, the production and stockpiling of these vaccines would require further funding, but the subscription model can be applied on an ongoing basis, and at a much lower annual cost. Access to these vaccines by non-G7 countries must also be considered, but such access involves political and ethical issues that are beyond the scope of this economic analysis."
34457,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"These results suggest that a government-led subscription model is financially feasible and would likely yield significant economic and political benefits to all participating governments. While the usual challenges of broad multi-national cooperation must be overcome, early traction from organizations such as Civica Rx suggests that focused, inclusive collaboration can ensure sustained supplies of life-saving drugs (32). "
34457,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"Vaccines only sell for a fraction of their economic value, in some cases for only a few dollars. They provide myriad benefits, like enabling would-be patients to live longer, healthier lives (33, 34) , and bearing yet-undervalued gains in productivity and positive externalities to society at large (35) (36) (37) . Although the low price of vaccines is meant to benefit individuals and regions with lower incomes, in the long run, it has had the opposite effect, causing them to be medically underserved due to a lack of vaccine investment. Pharmaceutical companies and investors are directing their resources to projects in which the estimated return on investment is more predictable and lucrative. Vaccine prices are currently set far below the prices of drugs that treat other serious conditions, such as cancer, despite the enormous societal value of vaccines in general, and those to ensure global health security in particular."
34457,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"In addition to pricing, another challenge lies in assessing the future demand for EID vaccines. Due to the inherent unpredictability in the scale and timing of outbreaks, the future demand for a specific EID vaccine is typically unclear. An additional factor is geopolitical. Diseases that are traditionally found in only a few, lower-income countries may not attract as many R&D dollars because generating a return on investment is more difficult in those limited markets (25, 38) . While wealthier governments might issue purchase agreements to assure vaccine sponsors of returns (38), these commitments are more difficult to secure for EIDs in lower-income countries or those undergoing economic hardship. However, an increasing number of stakeholders are realizing the danger of this dynamic for low and high-income countries alike, as under epidemic outbreak conditions, diseases like Zika and Ebola have the potential to spread much further than their traditional locales. The Ebola outbreaks in West Africa in 2014 demonstrate how the absence of vaccine demand prior to an event may result in a tragic loss of life and a regional economic setback. It is a significant concern that years after those outbreaks, the demand for Ebola vaccines remains limited and uncertain, allowing gaps in preparedness to persist (39) (40) (41) ."
34457,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"Unless these market challenges are addressed, the global population will remain vulnerable to substantial human and economic losses when epidemics and pandemics arise."
34457,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"Perhaps key to the problem of EID vaccine funding is a deficiency in the pricing of the risk of infection by EIDs. Although the prevention of epidemics and pandemics saves countless lives and billions of dollars of economic value, the revenue realized by vaccine manufacturers is only a very small fraction of this value. With this in mind, an examination of a capitated fee structure-a subscription model-applied to vaccine development and acquisition is promising. Under the current model, vaccines are purchased a la carte after outbreaks begin."
34457,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"As past efforts demonstrate, the key to generating interest in developing vaccine assets is to offer sufficient financial incentives for would-be developers, such as direct market commitments or priority review vouchers. Closing the gap between the economic value of"
34457,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"In Table S9 , we find that the expected return of the portfolio increases as the cost per project decreases. Similarly, Table S10 reports that the expected return of the portfolio increases as the probability of success of each project increases. However, even under more optimistic assumptions, the expected annualized return of the megafund for the base case remains significantly negative, increasing from -61.1% to only -57.4% when the probability of success is increased by 150%. This sensitivity analysis underscores the robustness of our results, and demonstrates that an EID vaccine portfolio remains economically unviable even under relatively optimistic cost and revenue assumptions."
34493,Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England: a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults,"The COVID-19 pandemic may cause excess mortality over the next year in the population both because of deaths among those infected, and because people who are not infected are experiencing social and economic upheaval; meanwhile the ability of health services to provide high quality of care for both infected and uninfected patients is increasingly threatened."
34495,The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"Populations in almost every country are now currently weighing whether, or when, the health benefits of anti-contagion policies are worth the costs they impose on society. For example, restrictions imposed on businesses are increasing unemployment, 19 travel bans are bankrupting airlines, 20 and school closures may have enduring impacts on affected students. 21 It is therefore not surprising that some populations hesitate before implementing such dramatic policies, particularly when these costs are visible while their health benefits -infections and deaths that would have occurred but instead were avoided or delayed -are unseen. Our objective is to measure this direct benefit; specifically, how much these policies slowed the growth rate of infections. We treat recently implemented policies as hundreds of different natural experiments proceeding in parallel. Our hope is to learn from the recent experience of six countries where the virus has advanced enough to trigger largescale policy actions, in part so that societies and decision-makers in the remaining 180+ countries can access this information immediately."
34495,The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"We employ well-established ""reduced-form"" econometric techniques 23, 24 commonly used to measure the effect of policies 25, 26 or other events (e.g., wars 27 or environmental changes 28 ) on economic growth rates. Similarly to early COVID-19 infections, economic output generally increases exponentially with a variable rate that can be affected by policy or other conditions. Unlike process-based epidemiological models, 7-9, 12, 22, 29, 30 the reduced-form statistical approach to inference that we apply does not require explicit prior information about fundamental epidemiological parameters or mechanisms, many of which remain unknown in the current pandemic. Rather, the collective influence of these factors is empirically recovered from the data without modeling their individual effects explicitly (see Methods). Prior work on influenza, 31 for example, has shown that such statistical approaches can provide important complementary information to process-based models."
34495,The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"To construct the dependent variable, we transform location-specific, sub-national time-series of infections into first-differences of their natural logarithm, which is the per day growth rate of infections (see Methods). We use data from first-or second-level administrative units and data on active or cumulative cases, depending on availability (see Appendix Section 2). We then employ widely-used panel regression models 23, 24 to estimate how the daily growth rate of infections changes over time within a location when different combinations of large-scale social policies are enacted (see Methods). Our econometric approach accounts for differences in the baseline growth rate of infections across locations due to differences in demographics, socio-economic status, culture, or health systems across localities within a country; it accounts for systemic patterns in growth rates within countries unrelated to policy, such as the effect of the work-week; it is robust to systematic under-surveillance; and it accounts for changes in procedures to diagnose positive cases (see Methods and Appendix Section 2). The reduced-form statistical techniques we use are designed to measure the total magnitude of the effect of changes in policy, without attempting to explain the origin of baseline growth rates or the specific epidemiological mechanisms linking policy changes to infection growth rates (see Methods). Thus, this approach does not provide the important mechanistic insights generated by process-based models; however, it does effectively quantify the key policyrelevant relationships of interest using recent real-world data when fundamental epidemiological parameters are still uncertain."
34495,The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"We estimate a multiple regression version of Equation 6 using ordinary least squares. We include a vector of sub-national unit-fixed effects θ 0 (i.e. varying intercepts captured as coefficients to dummy variables) to account for all time-invariant factors that affect the local growth rate of infections, such as differences in demographics, socio-economic status, culture, or health systems. 24 We include a vector of day-of-week-fixed effects δ to account for weekly patterns in the growth rate of infections that are common across locations within a country. We include a separate singleday dummy variable each time there is an abrupt change in the availability of COVID-19 testing or a change in the procedure to diagnose positive cases. Such changes generally manifest as a discontinuous jump in infections and a re-scaling of subsequent infection rates (e.g. See China in Figure 1 ), effects that are flexibly absorbed by a single-day dummy variable because the dependent variable is the first-difference of the logarithm of infections. Denote the vector of these testing dummies µ."

34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"In the absence of a vaccine, social distancing remains the only option to slow down the spread of the disease and arrest potential mortality. Governments around the world are now enacting aggressive policies, including ""shelter in place"" and emergency closures of all nonessential services, which carry severe economic and social consequences. For example, in the last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and the White House have recommended extreme social distancing in order to slow down the current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (5). However, these measures are less aggressive than what has been put in place elsewhere (6) . There is still a great deal of uncertainty as to how strong social distancing recommendations must be or how long they must last. Importantly, national and regional social distancing policies are likely to impact individual cities differently."
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"Cities are predicated on extensive and intense socioeconomic interactions. Many of their measurable properties -from the size of their economies, to their crime rates, to the prevalence of certain infectious diseases -are mediated by socioeconomic interactions. These interactions are subject to well known scaling effects, which are magnified by city population size (7) . All of these relationships are tied to socioeconomic networks with average degree (number of social connections per capita) that increases approximately as a power law of city size k(N ) = k 0 N δ , with δ 1/6 (7, 8) ."
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"These observations have a number of implications that might inform evolving national, regional, and local responses to the outbreak of COVID-19. First, it is particularly important for larger cities to act quickly to contain this outbreak. Second, social distancing will impact cities differently based on city size. From the perspective of containing the outbreak, larger cities require more aggressive social distancing policies, corresponding to a larger p R . At the same time, once the outbreak is contained it might be possible to relax social distancing policies in smaller cities first, allowing a faster return to normal life and economic activity compared to more populous cities."
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"These distinctions may help to bring more nuance to ongoing strategies for suppression and control of COVID-19, including gradually restoring socioeconomic activity in context appropriate and safe ways."
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"Finally, as strategies for controlling this outbreak continue to evolve, it is critical to keep in mind that almost everything that we appreciate about urban environments, including their economic prowess, their ability to innovate, and their role in their inhabitants social and mental health, is predicated on network effects mediated by socioeconomic interactions. The ability to succeed against a fast emerging epidemic like COVID-19 depends on preserving as much person-to-person connectivity (e.g., through technology), while stopping disease transmission."
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"Research on safe types of socioeconomic contact and exchange is therefore paramount so that we can succeed in controlling this outbreak while maintaining livelihoods, socioeconomic capacity, and mental health. This can in principle be done through approaches that make the most of emerging, real-time data to create context appropriate suppression strategies at local, regional, national, and global levels."
34506,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"The higher socioeconomic connectivity of larger cities in a fast urbanizing world makes containing emergent epidemics harder. But the density of socioeconomic connections in cities can also facilitate the spread of information, social coordination, and innovations necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19. This information and associated actions can easily spread much faster than the biological viral contagion. To fight an exponential, we need to create an even faster exponential! .

34545,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"Our model and conclusions relies on the separation of the population based on age and health into two compartments with very different outcomes. Of course there could be a certain grey area where the separation between the two subpopulations is not always clear. In this case the separation should be determined as a usual trade-off between resources available and risk. The immunity may not be complete but from the limited information currently available on Covid-19, it appears to be fairly robust. In the absence of alternative options available the development of population level immunity could be the optimal resolution of the global pandemic at least in regions where the infection is already widespread, e.g. in Western Europe. Some countries, for example Italy and Spain, implemented severe social distancing, but so far seems to be unable to stop the progress of the epidemic and may in fact be on track towards achieving large scale immunity in the population. However, with too much focus on the implementation of uniform social distancing and no clear targeted measures for identifying and efficiently protecting the vulnerable sub-population can lead to a very dangerous scenario with high mortality in spite of the high social and economic costs of an extended and potentially recurrent epidemic.

34587,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","This pathogen represents a significant challenge for public health, pandemic planning, and healthcare systems. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible (4) (5) (6) (7) . It causes moderate to severe clinical outcomes in approximately 20% of all recognized infected individuals (5, 8, 9) . In the absence of a vaccine, public health responses have focused on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (10) . These NPIs include: (1) ""case-based"" measures such as testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, and (2) ""non-case-based"" measures such as reducing the probability of transmission given an effective contact (e.g. hand hygiene, and cough etiquette), and social distancing measures to reduce the contact rate in the population. Social distancing minimizes opportunities for person-to-person transmission of the virus to occur. These social distancing measures include some combination of school closure, teleworking, cancellation of group activities and events, and a general overall reduction in community contacts. While they are expected to be effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they are also associated with substantial economic costs and social disruption."
34587,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","Societal disruption measures could include outcomes such as the overall duration of time that the intervention needs to be to achieve the associated reductions in morbidity and mortality. A challenge for pandemic response using NPIs is that, in a fully susceptible population, although NPIs may slow disease transmission while they are in place, once the intervention is lifted (or compliance with the intervention becomes low), the transmission of the pathogen rebounds rapidly (10, 12) . In the case of COVID-19, it may not be possible to minimize morbidity and mortality, and societal and economic disruption at the same time."

While severe illness, particularly in older individuals, is frequent enough to overwhelm a society's ICU capacity (19) , mild unrecognized illness (particularly in younger individuals) contributes to spread (20) , and epidemics may only be recognized when superspreader events occur (21) , often in vulnerable settings like health care facilities (22) . In contrast to SARS (23), the high frequency of mild cases means that strategies which focus on case identification and isolation alone are likely to fail (22) . Control strategies for COVID-19 thus need to balance competing risks: the risks of mortality and health system collapse, on the one hand, against economic risks and attendant hardships (and health consequences) on the other. In this work, we evaluated plausible strategies for attenuating the COVID-19 epidemic in Ontario, Canada. We focussed on ICU resources for two reasons: first, because this component of most health systems represents a scarce resource prone to being saturated; and secondly because such saturation results in abrupt surges in casefatality, as individuals with acute respiratory distress syndrome will die quickly without the .

How large is the risk of any individual to get infected on a particular day or within a week? How does this risk change over time? How large is the expected number of individuals ever infected and how large is the number of individuals infected at any point in time? The latter question is the main concern of the public, politicians and health practitioners to ensure su¢ cient provision of health services. Finally, what are the e¤ects of policy interventions that are already implemented and that are being discussed? This paper starts by describing what we know quantitatively about the spread of the Corona epidemic in the Chinese province of Hubei and in South Korea. This o¤ers insights from two episodes of epidemics that seem to be coming to an end and that help in making predictions for other countries. We then compare the time-series evidence from Hubei and South Korea with cross-sectional information in European countries."
34655,Projecting the Spread of COVID19 for Germany,"Why should economists work on an epidemic? The economic costs of COVID-19 are huge and seem to be larger than those of the …nancial crisis starting in 2007. 4 This paper provides a model that allows to understand the spread of the disease. We employ a model in the tradition of search and matching models originating from Diamond (1982) , Mortensen (1982) and Pissarides (1985) . The basic structure of these models (continuous time Markov chains) is identical to epidemiological models (as becomes clear very quickly when reading overviews like e.g. Hethcote, 2000) . Compared to standard search and matching models, we do allow for four states, however. We extend the typical matching framework from a technical perspective by taking the stochastic nature of transitions and their prediction for the probability to be in various states into account. These probabilities are described by forward Kolmogorov equations. As we work with a discrete number of states, we obtain an ordinary di¤erential equation system. 5 The conclusion discusses various next steps that should be undertaken to understand economic consequences of COVID-19 better. We believe that our framework can form the basis for an understanding of economic costs of the pandemic."
34655,Projecting the Spread of COVID19 for Germany,"This section describes what we know quantitatively about the spread of reported infections. We start with Hubei and its capital Wuhan in China. We afterwards look at South Korea and very brie ‡y at Japan. We focus on the evolution of the number of individuals that were ever reported to be sick during the current epidemic. This number, by construction, can only rise. We chose Hubei and South Korea as the epidemics seem to come to an end in these countries. Given the huge uncertainty about long-run infection rates and individual risk to get sick after an infection with CoV-2, we consider the long-run ratios of sick reported individuals to the overall population a benchmark that allows us to judge the credibility of our predictions for Germany. We are aware that we compare very di¤erent countries with very di¤erent cultural and political habits and medical systems. For reference, we also look at a cross section of infections for European countries. See the appendix for a description of data sources. 6 Hubei Since the onset of the outbreak in the Hubei province in China, the number of con…rmed cases has risen dramatically, peaking at 67,801 (WHO Situation Reports, 2020). 7 Reporting began in January 2020 and we note that in mid-February, the WHO changed its classi…cation methodology by reporting both clinically and lab con…rmed cases rather than only lab con…rmed cases. In terms of cumulative numbers, the total reported cases of infected individuals rose 4 Eichenbaum et al. (2020) study the e¤ects of the CoV-2 epidemic on economic decisions of households. They emphasize the household decisions to reduce labour supply exacerbate the recessionary e¤ects of the epidemic. They apply their model to the US. Barro et al. (2020) employ mortalities and economic consequences of the ""Spanish Flu"" to provide estimates of the world wide consequences of COVID19. They do not o¤er a detailed projection for Germany. The costs for Germany are estimated by Dorn et al. (2020) . Atkeson (2020) provides esitmates of economic consequences of COVID19 for the US. 5 When working with continuous states like e.g. wealth or labour income, partial di¤erential equations result.

34655,Projecting the Spread of COVID19 for Germany,"We compare the daily risk of 1 in 10,000 or the weekly risk of 7 in 10,000 with the long-run risk of 7 in 100 by the end of the epidemic to be or have been sick (as discussed after …gure 4), it seems that at the individual level, the daily or even weekly risk of the epidemic is not really a major health risk. 19 It is clear, however, that at the level of society, the epidemic is a major issue. This di¤erence between the individual risk and aggregate outcomes is the result of a classic negative externality. Even individuals that take into account the overall risk of 7 in 100 to turn sick might not be concerned. If the risk of infecting others was taken into account, individual behaviour would look di¤erently. This is why governmental interventions have a clear justi…cation from the perspective of market failure and public economics."

We calculate total societal costs of the pandemic and corresponding non-pharmaceutical measures. These costs include three components: costs of mortality, costs of illness and costs of reduced economic activity due to mitigation and precautionary demand."
34668,Inclusive Costs of NPI Measures for COVID-19 Pandemic: Three Approaches,"Economic costs come from three sources: direct costs of illness and treatment, employment losses and losses due to falling demand or mandatory shutdowns. This approach is consistent with the standard approaches used to estimate economic costs of the epidemic Falling demand and mandatory shutdowns affect transport, food services, accommodation, arts and recreation. In the herd immunity approach, food services, arts and recreation shut down completely. Air transport loses 70% of output (note that about 15% of revenue in the US comes from mail and cargo) while ground transport and accommodation lose 50% of output for the duration of NPI measures (until May 2022). There are no mandatory shutdowns in the laissez-faire approach, but for peak infection month people avoid shopping in public places. For simplicity, we assume that the decrease in demand during the peak month of the epidemic (June 2020) is equal to the decrease in demand experienced due to social distancing measures in the herd immunity approach."

It is found that the latter can significantly reduce the percentage of people getting infected and the death toll. It is important to emphasize here that more testing has to be applied to individuals without symptoms, since those with symptoms contain themselves automatically in most cases. As improved testing capacities are built up, our approach may help to decide when alternative mitigation methods may not only complement, but eventually replace the current social distancing regime. This may help to minimize the socio-economical impacts resulting from severe social isolation policies. While social distancing is currently essential, it is of utmost importance that the testing capabilities are upgraded such that they cover large portions of affected populations in the near future."
34719,Modeling of COVID-19 Pandemic and Scenarios for Containment,"While the paper simulates various scenarios of containment, it does not address the economic cost of each scenario. In line with recent findings, the note argues that a fast and aggressive multi-layer intervention is needed to have a substantial dent of the transmission. What the paper calls for is a clear and transparent strategy by governments to implement social distancing and aggressive testing. The testing, should be targeted to geographic locations that the virus is wide spread, to airports and cruise ships, to road travellers, and anyone who has been in areas that are hot spot or has been in any contact with someone in affected locations over the past two weeks. The strategy should not ""just"" focus on those that show symptoms but should include ""all"" who might have been exposed. In this exceptional environment, governments can use temporarily a combination of location data and credit card information to track COVID-19 in their countries and use surveillance tools to monitor quarantined individuals."

Table 1 reports the number of death and recoveries at end-2020. Obviously, the combined set of policies, described in scenario v yields the best outcome with the lowest fatality and infected cases. Comparing scenario iii and iv, we conclude that a combined intensive testing, identifying infected individuals, and quarantine is a more effective policy than just a shelter-in-place policy. As discussed, scenario vi is the same as scenario v, assuming that the authorities end the shelterin-place policy 30-days after the peak of the pandemic. Unfortunately, under such scenario the death toll can be still multiplied by 4 times compared to the scenario where social interactions are just reduced and kept low by 50 percent. If the social interaction is increased to normal times, the death toll can be 15 times larger than in the scenario v. Many governments are impatient to open their countries businesses. They are rightly worried about the economic cost of a prolonged shutdown of economic activity. There are already outcry across countries by those who have lost their jobs. Many in low income and developing countries cannot afford to stay in home for long, since there are not enough safety nets to protect the most vulnerable. On the other hand, even in advanced economies, the ripple effect of a lengthy and uncertain shutdown of the economy is too painful. This is the reason that countries' authorities have to start implementing a broad range of decisive actions."

Unlike the current approach in some countries, where only the symptomatic cases are tested, the authorities should provide intensive and extensive testing and try to identify almost-all infected cases. This process would identify asymptomatic but infected cases and stop them of spreading the virus. This is key for a successful containment policy. Given the geographic distribution of the pandemic, the testing should focus on the most affected locations first and then expand to those people who have visited the hot spots or have been in contact with anyone in those areas, while everyone practice social distancing. A combination policy, as discussed above, not only reduces the number of infected, and ultimately the death toll, but it shorten the shelter-in-place period and consequently lowers the economic cost."
34723,Computational Design of Peptides to Block Binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein to Human ACE2,"The continuing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) has now become an international public health threat, causing inconceivable loss of lives and economic instability 1 . As of March 28, 2020, there have been more than 570000 confirmed cases and over 26000 deaths caused by COVID-19 worldwide 2 . Exacerbating the problem, there is no specific antiviral medication toward COVID-19, though development efforts are underway [3] [4] [5] [6] . Although vaccines are thought to be the most powerful weapon to fight against virus invasion, it may take quite a long time to develop and clinically test the safety of a vaccine. Moreover, vaccines are usually limited as preventative measures given to uninfected individuals. Thus, as an emergency measure, it is desirable to develop effective antiviral therapeutics that can take effect rapidly not only to treat COVID-19 and but also to prevent its further transmission."

We focus on China for two reasons. First, China was 2 For example, the satellite images show dramatic declines in NO2 in U.S., China, and Europe: US: https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/23/health/us-pollution-satellite-coronavirus-scn-trnd/index.html; China: https://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146362/airborne-nitrogen-dioxide-plummetsover-china; Europe: https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/air-pollution-goes-down-as. Relatedly, a news article on Forbes provided some rough estimates on the potential benefits caused by city lockdown in China: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2020/03/16/coronavirus-lockdown-may-have-saved-77000-lives-in-china-just-from-pollution-reduction. hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak, and the Chinese government launched draconian countermeasures to prevent the escalation of the infections (Chen et al., 2020; Kucharski et al., 2020) . Nearly one-third of Chinese cities were locked down in a top-down manner, and various types of economic activities were strictly prohibited. In these cities, individuals were requested to stay at home, unnecessary commercial operations, private and public gatherings were suspended, transportations were largely banned (both within a city and across cities), mandatory temperature checking could be found in most public facilities. Second, China also suffers greatly from severe air pollution problems, with some estimates suggesting that air pollution is associated with an annual loss of nearly 25 million healthy life years (Kassebaum et al., 2014) . If city lockdown indeed significantly improved the air quality in China, the implied health benefits would be an order of magnitude larger than in countries with lower initial pollution levels."
34771,"COVID-19, City Lockdown, and Air Pollution: Evidence from China","Panel A shows that impact is much more significant in colder cities or ones located in the North. The estimated reduction in the AQI is around 20~30 points for those cities and is 0~10 points in warmer or Southern cities. The difference could be driven by the fact that colder cities consumed more coals for heating, and lockdown reduces such consumption in offices, plants, and schools, which eventually led to a greater improvement in air quality. In Panel B, we see the effect is greater in cities with larger GDP, population, and higher income (measured by per capita GDP). This is consistent with the fact that energy consumption is higher in more agglomerated economies, where a lot of economic activities take place. Finally, Panels C and D show that in the cities that rely more on industrial activities (measured by the manufacturing output, the volume of traffic, the number of firms, and the emissions of different types of pollutants), the effect is more substantial.

After the disease introduction to Poland, there is a peak on the introduction day and fast growth of interest in epidemic and mitigation phase [ Fig. 9 ]. Under conditions of a market-consumer society, private goals of individuals come into conflict with responsibility of the whole society or community. For example, economic consequence of supply and demand lead to price increases of medical devices ( [43] )."
34774,Perception of emergent epidemic of COVID-2019 / SARS CoV-2 on the Polish Internet,"In order to prepare and manage the crisis in an optimal way, a deeper perception analysis in the form of reliable quantitative and qualitative analysis is required. Especially, according to the results of empirical research (Taranowicz [46] ), society expects institutional activities and in the event of an epidemic, it is the ""state (...) that is responsible for the poor health of the population"". Perhaps one of the reasons the Chinese have been so successful in controlling the spread of the infection is that social media like Wechat (Wang et al. [47] , Zhang et al. [48] ), or Internet forums (Liu and Lu [49] ) were analyzed by algorithms (Lu et al. [50] , Paul and Dredze [51] , Salathe et al. [52] ) with a goal to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Combining the behavior changes detected via social media analysis with the detailed information on human mobility via e.g. mobile phone tracking (Schneider et al. [53] ), sophisticated computational models of infectious disease spread could be implemented (Belik et al. [54] , Vespignani [55] ) allowing to simulate various scenarios and assess possible human and economic losses. Furthermore, impact of public information campaigns could be measured by internal surveys of public opinion. In addition, Internet media analysis could fill gaps in socio-medical research on collective actions during an important public health disruption event such as infectious diseases. (Jarynowski and Belik [56] )."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"(3) those affected may be contagious during a prolonged asymptomatic incubation period, and many never develop symptoms distinctive from a mild flu, making it difficult to identify and isolate the infected before they pass the virus to others. (4) Broad public mandates for social distancing are also vital to help manage a key multiplier of COVID-19 fatality rates: a substantial fraction of patients require lengthy (on average 8 bed days) intensive care unit (ICU) support to survive acute respiratory distress, and uncontrolled spread of the disease is expected to generate at its peak far greater demand for ICU care than existing capacity can meet.(5; 2; 6) Public health experts have pleaded with officials to quickly mandate social distancing to flatten the curve of coronavirus infections -that is, reduce the peak caseload -before exponential case growth leads to hundreds of thousands or millions of deaths. In particular, it is important to keep peak levels low to prevent the fatality rate from rising to the levels seen in areas where hospitals are overwhelmed with cases. (7) In the United States, the emergence of the coronavirus has created a natural experiment in which elected officials face incredibly urgent and far-reaching policy decisions for which they typically have no personal experience or expertise, and for which the history of policy examples is either mere days old, or so dated as to be largely unknown except by public health experts. The most significant policy decisions of this kindboth in terms of their potential to mitigate the epidemic and their economic consequences -are mandates for social distancing through restrictions on public gatherings; closure or restriction of schools, restaurants, and other non-essential businesses; and orders for the public to stay at home. (8) Under the federal and state constitutions, the key actions fall to executives, and particularly to governors, whose powers in public health emergencies are typically singular and extensive."
34796,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Evidence from the 1918 influenza pandemic underscores the stakes for elected officials. In that earlier natural experiment, American cities faced similar decisions regarding social distancing policies. For example, Philadelphia decided to hold a parade welcoming soldiers returning from World War I, while St. Louis cancelled its parade, and ultimately experienced one eighth as many deaths per capita during that wave of influenza. The height of the infection in Saint Louis was two months later than in Philadelphia, and was far lower, with deaths peaking at fifty per hundred thousand rather than 250 per hundred thousand.(11; 12) Shortly after community transmission of the coronavirus was discovered in Washington and California in late February 2020, public health experts drew the comparison between Philadelphia and Saint Louis, hoping to inspire policymakers to promote social distancing. Nevertheless, in an echo of the decisions made a century before, there are significant differences in the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. For instance, on 6 March 2020, after Kentucky had its first confirmed case of COVID-19, Governor Andy Beshear (D) immediately called a state of emergency, encouraged social distancing, and closed bars and restaurants ten days later. But when neighboring Tennesse uncovered its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 5th, Governor Bill Lee (R) waited until 12 March to declare a state of emergency and finally closed restaurants and bars on 22 March. (13) Why did governors' responses to a sudden, shared threat differ? Under normal circumstances, governors' policy decisions are shaped by the national leaders and agenda of their political party and the demands of their own constituents, particularly those in their partisan base. Governors may also look to innovative peers and neighbors for examples to follow. But the fast-moving nature of the coronavirus threat, the need to rely on experts to understand complex scientific material, and uncertainty about the nature and scope of the threat might scramble all or some of these usual motivations. pandemic politics · Adolph, Amano, Bang-Jensen, Fullman & Wilkerson The public health case for mandatory social distancing in the United States developed quickly in the wake of the first reports of community transmission on 26 February in Washington state. One might expect social distancing measures to quickly follow across the fifty states, perhaps more quickly in states with greater number of confirmed cases. But mandating social distancing is a difficult decision for any political leader. If these measures are successful in preventing widespread mortality, many members of the public who suffered the costs of these mandates may never fully comprehend the benefits. Indeed, the more successful the intervention, the more likely it will appear to many as an ""overreaction."" Moreover, some states faced higher potential costs from these policies: closing schools is more painful in states where more children depend on schools for subsidized lunches and shutting restaurants and public places is more difficult in states highly dependent on tourism. (14) More generally, states with more limited economic resources are likely far less able to weather the deprivations caused by economic shutdowns, or to expand social insurance protections during mandated social distancing, and thus may be considerably more reluctant to take these steps."

35158,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"The above improvements in the healthcare sector can only be achieved if different smart city products are fashioned to support standardized protocols that would allow for seamless communication between themselves. Weber and Podnar Žarko [9] suggest that IoT devices in use should support open protocols, and at the same time, the device provider should ensure that those fashioned uphold data integrity and safety during communication and transmission. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, as Vermesan and Friess [10] explain, most smart city products use proprietary solutions that are only understood by the service providers. This situation often creates unnecessary fragmentation of information rendering only a partial integrated view on the dynamics of the urban realm. With restricted knowledge on emergent trends, urban managers cannot effectively take decisions to contain outbreaks and adequately act without compromising the social and economic integrity of their city. This paper, inspired by the case of the COVID-19 virus, explores how urban resilience can be further achieved, and outlines the importance of seeking standardization of communication across and between smart cities."
35158,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"While the significance of such data in advancing efficiency, productivity and processes in different sectors is being lauded, there are criticisms arising as to the nature of data collection, storage, management and accessibility by only a small group of users. The latter particularly includes select ICT corporations that are also located in specific geographies [6, [14] [15] [16] [17] . These criticisms are justified, as in recent years, big data is seen as the new 'gold rush' of the 21st century and limiting its access means higher economic returns and increased influence and control at various scales to those who control data. These associated benefits with big data are clearly influencing geopolitical standings, in both corporate and conventional governance realms, and there is increased competition between powerful economies to ensure that they have the maximum control of big data. As case in point is the amount of 'push and pull' that has arisen from Huawei's 5G internet planned rollout [18] . Though the latter service offers unprecedented opportunities to increase internet speeds, and thereby influence the handling of big data, countries like the U.S. and some European countries that are key proponents and players in global political, economic and health landscapes, are against this rollout, arguing that it is a deceptive way of gathering private data under the guise of espionage. On this, it has been noted that the issue of data control and handling by a few corporations accords with their principles of nationalism, and that these work for their own wellbeing as well as to benefit the territories they are registered in. Therefore, geopolitical issues are expected on the technological front as most large data-rich corporations are located in powerful countries that have influence both economically, health-wise and politically [19] [20] [21] . Such are deemed prized tokens on the international landscape, and it is expected that these economies will continue to work towards their predominant control as much as possible. On the health sector, the same approach is being upheld where critical information and data are not freely shared between economies as that would be seen to be benefiting other in-competition economies, whereas different economies would cherish the maximization of benefits from such data collections."
35158,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"The outbreak of any disease has significant impacts on local economies across the globe. For instance, when SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) (SARS-CoV) broke in China in 2002, it was estimated, that the Asian region incurred tremendous negative impacts socially, health-wise and economically, potentially amounting to Asian regional economy losses of between USD $12-18 billion from tourism, travel and retail sales industries alone [27] . The Zika virus outbreak, spread by daytime-active Aedes mosquitoes, is estimated to have cost equator-belt local economies in affected areas between USD $7 and USD $18 billion [28] . The Ebola virus (or Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF)) caused an estimated loss of USD $2.2 billion in GDP in three West African economies (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) in 2015 alone [29] . In regard to the current epidemic of Coronavirus, though it is too early to quantify or project its impacts on the global economy, there are fears that it may take the precedent of other outbreaks where billions of dollars will be lost. The foundations for this escalating loss can be witnessed in the rapid growth of travel bans being enacted by some countries and their international airports, especially specifically restricting people from visiting the affected regions in China and their growth into general non-Chinese travel movements. On this, noting that the outbreak came almost on the eve of the Lunar New Year celebrations, and that it had been estimated that over 400 million people were expected to travel in different parts of the world and China to observe this festivity, the majority have had to reconsider their options as to flights, hotels and entertainment events due to service provider cancellations [30] . Those who had already booked their flights are expected to receive their refunds following the directive by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, however, this move has already affected the share value of Chinese airline companies [30] ."
35158,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"The above impacts demonstrate that the issues of virus outbreaks transcend urban safety and impacts upon all other facets of our urban fabric. Therefore, it becomes paramount to ensure that the measures taken to contain a virus transcend nationalist agendas where data and information sharing is normally restricted, to a more global agenda where humanity and global order are encouraged. With such an approach, it would be easier to share urban health data across geographies to better monitor emerging health threats in order to provide more economic stability, thereby ensuring no disruptions on such sectors like tourism and travel industries, amongst others. This is possible by ensuring collaborative, proactive measures to control outbreak spread and thus, human movements. This would remove fears on travelers, and would have positive impacts upon the tourism industry, that has been seen to bear the economic brunt whenever such outbreaks occur. This can be achieved by ensuring that protocols on data sharing are calibrated to remove all hurdles pertaining to sharing of information. On this, Lawpoolsri et al. [31] posits that such issues, like transparency, timelessness of sharing and access and quality of data, should be upheld so that continuous monitoring and assessment can be pursued."
35158,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"However, despite the indisputable roles that installed devices play in providing relevant health information, their data communication aspect needs to be reviewed. First, communications are seen to be geography-restricted (restricted to a given location), such that they seldom expand or communicate with their like, installed beyond their restricted areas. Secondly, these devices are usually sourced and installed by separate corporations that maintain unique and specific standards for data processing and sharing, and accordingly, tying cities to the sole usage of their product(s). Such strategies are adopted as private corporations try to maximize their economic gains, since the digital solution market is a lucrative one and is expected to continue growing and expanding [6, 7] ."
35158,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"With scenarios like the present Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, that not only impacts upon the economic status of cities, but also affects their social standing, it becomes imperative to emphasize the adoption of universal standards for data sharing. Such a move could have far reaching impact across cities and territories especially in positively combating outbreaks and disasters in a quicker, safer and standardized way, such that when the cure is discovered, the results can be replicated in various parts of the globe. With a collaborated data sharing protocol, it would be possible to have a larger dataset resulting in increased processing capabilities especially with technologies that are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Through this way, as noted by Jiang et al. [36] and Allam [37] , it would be possible to facilitate early detection, achieve better diagnosis and provide better urban management decisions for increased efficiency for virus containment."

36655,"Potential scenarios for the progression of a COVID-19 epidemic in the European Union and the European Economic Area, March 2020","• Large outbreaks now taking place outside of China increase the rate of importation into and within the EU/EEA, challenging the containment strategy currently in place. • Some countries are reporting fewer importations than would be inferred from travel volumes, suggesting that circulation of the virus is more widespread than it appears from case detection and a pandemic may occur sooner than expected [9] . • Globalisation of trade and frequent international travel will facilitate the spread of the virus. • Vaccines and antiviral treatments are under development but may not be widely available for several months or even years. • The outbreak could cause substantial social, political and economic disruption also in parts of the world not directly affected by the virus."
36699,Assessing the Impact of Reduced Travel on Exportation Dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19),"Although the COVID-19 epidemic was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO), the WHO specifically called upon member states to not restrict the freedom of movement of persons as a result of the epidemic [22] . However, member states did not adhere to this recommendation and have varyingly restricted the free movement of people from China [23] . Such restrictions were most drastic in China, where some cities were put on complete lockdown [23] . These political decisions regarding movement restrictions must balance the expected epidemiological impact with predicted economic burden-the latter of which we did not examine. While securing a few days delay to epidemic spread in China would secure time for healthcare systems in Chinese cities that have not yet been affected to prepare for the appearance of case-patients [21] , the impact of such a delay outside China is not substantial enough to accomplish meaningful prevention, such as the development, manufacturing, and distribution of a vaccine."
36733,Influence of trust on two different risk perceptions as an affective and cognitive dimension during Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea: serial cross-sectional surveys,"Demographic factors evaluated as respondents' characteristics included gender, age, educational attainment, occupation, perceived household economic status, residential area, and political orientation/party (party identification). Educational attainment was classified into five levels (less than middle school, high school, university, graduate school or higher). Educational attainment was investigated in all surveys except survey 1. Occupation was classified as either unemployed, farming and fishery, self-employed, blue-collar worker, white-collar worker, fulltime housewife, or student. Perceived household economic status was classified into five levels (lower, lower middle, middle, upper middle, upper). Respondents were classified as either metropolitan or non-metropolitan residents; and distinguished by whether they resided in an area where MERS had occurred or not. Party identification was classified based on the support for the president or the political parties. Support or lack of support for the president was assessed using the options of ""approval"", ""disapproval"", or ""no opinion"", while support for the party identification was assessed based on alignment either with the ruling party, with the opposition party, or no opinion."

Majority of the participants were employed, were in the middle economic status, metropolitan, without societal-level risk perception (controlled). Figure 1 reports how the outbreak proceeded, with three overlapping transmission periods, the timing of the five independent surveys, and the risk perception rates. Noticeable differences were investigated between personal-level and societal-level risk proportions throughout the epidemic periods. Overall risk perception at personal-level proportion (56.5%) was nearly two times higher than at societal-level (30.3%). Personal-level risk perception proportions were always higher than societal-level during the present study periods.

It is consistent with previous studies that trust in government could shape the public`s risk perception (both affective and cognitive). 21 22 26 27 However, the previous studies have not distinguished between affective and cognitive reaction when evaluating the impact of trust regarding contagious diseases during outbreaks. 3 12 23 24 28-30 Our findings suggest that trust in government is correlated with both affective and cognitive risk perception and it is important to understand the relationship between trust in government and two different aspects of risk perceptions. Those who did not support the president were reported to have had higher risk perception in both the affective and cognitive levels. In the group that did not approve of the president, the probabilities of risk perception were higher at the cognitive dimension than at affective dimension. In the early days of the MERS-COV outbreak, the government did not specify details regarding scientifically uncertain information in order to reduce public anxiety over the crisis, nor did the government disclose which hospitals the confirmed patients had visited. This resulted in increased public distrust in the government. 4 5 8 9 Similar patterns of distrust in the government was associated with the spread of infection, during the outbreak of Ebola. 34 35 Those who disapproved of the ruling party had also higher risk perceptions. Identification of party can be classified in the political aspect of trust. 36 There is need to investigate further comprehensive understanding of trust`s effect on risk perception. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y 17 Third, we found that gender, age, self-reported economic status, residential area, party identification correlated significantly with risk perception. According to multiple logistic regression analyses, being female predisposed to greater risk perception at the affective risk perception, but not at the cognitive dimension. Previous studies that investigated risk perception by gender also showed that a lower risk perception was associated with the male gender. 3 28 37-39 Possible explanation for lower perception of risk by male are that male have more to gain from risky behaviors. 40 However, previous studies did not distinguish between the level of risk perception. Further research is needed to determine why the same female group showed differences in perceived risk for affective and cognitive levels. The older the respondents, the lower the perceived cognitive dimension, but the opposite occurred weakly in the affective risk perception. The correlation with age and affective risk perception was not significant in most model (survey 1, survey 2, survey 3 models). After trust in government was adjusted for, we found correlation between older age and lower cognitive risk perception."
36733,Influence of trust on two different risk perceptions as an affective and cognitive dimension during Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea: serial cross-sectional surveys,"Given that some hierarchy-specific trends in income level were observed only in the overall model of affective risk perception, these results were consistent with previous studies. [41] [42] [43] The location effect on risk perception also was evaluated in this study, but it was not clear the correlation with risk proximity and risk perception. 44 There were no significant differences in the proportions of those with risk perception according to the major socioeconomic characteristics (education, income level, occupation). It is necessary to further investigate the correlation with demographic factors and risk perception. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   18 This study, which used a serial cross-sectional study design had some limitations. First, the study used a cross-sectional study design. Thus, causal relations between personal characteristics and risk perceptions could not be determined-rather, it could only suggest their relevance. Second, this study could not evaluate the intensity of risk perception, because it only included questions focusing on whether or not participants recognized the risk at the different levels. It would be useful to evaluate risk perceptions of respondents qualitatively if questions about the circumstances and characteristics of risk perception were surveyed in future studies."

Fourth, small sample size of some variables once stratified (e.g., self-reported household economic status)_led to the exclusion of major socioeconomic characteristics from further analyses."

Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare, and in particular intensive care."
37747,"Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020","On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as being a novel coronavirus now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . Since, the illness resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease . Evidence to date is that ca 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover [1] . In ca 14% cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospitalisation while the remaining 6% cases experience critical illness requiring intensive care. The mortality of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 is ca 4% [1] . In this study, we assess the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them to that of Hubei Province, China. We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy during 31 January-15 March 2020."
38154,SARS-CoV-2 is an appropriate name for the new coronavirus,"We have read with great interest the Correspondence by Shibo Jiang and colleagues, 1 in which they propose a name change for the newly emerged coronavirus, 2 which was recently designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. 3 The authors argued that the use of SARS in the virus name could confuse the public about the disease that it causes; in addition, they noted that the name SARS-CoV-2 is not consistent with the disease name chosen by WHO, coronavirus disease 2019. The authors also indicated that scientifically, SARS-CoV-2 is naturally occurring and different from other SARS-like or SARS-related coronaviruses that are mainly characterised by their genome sequences. Furthermore, given the probability of future attenuation of this virus to a low-pathogenic form, the authors predict that the use of the name SARS-CoV-2 might have adverse effects, both socially and economically. On these grounds, the authors suggest that the name of the new virus is changed to human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19). Although these concerns and suggestions are appreciated, we feel that the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group was appropriate."
38154,SARS-CoV-2 is an appropriate name for the new coronavirus,"We also believe that the use of the name SARS-CoV-2 will not affect social stability and economic development in the affected countries, as the authors envision. Given that the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is currently not well understood, and no effec t ive approach to stop such zoonotic transmission has been established, SARS-related coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 (or even SARS-CoV-3 in the future), might continue to emerge and reemerge. This has been exemplified in the transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, in which multiple spillover events occurred from camels to humans, resulting in human infec tions. 6 Thus, keeping SARS in the names of viruses of that species would be beneficial to keep the general public vigilant and prepared to respond quickly in the event of a new viral emergence.

We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020. A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February. Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers."
38355,"Laboratory readiness and response for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in expert laboratories in 30 EU/EEA countries, January 2020","In early January 2020, it became evident that a new pathogenic human coronavirus, provisionally named novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), had emerged in China [1, 2] . The virus is causing an outbreak, which started in the metropole Wuhan, but was seeded through travellers across China with ongoing secondary chains of transmission in a wider geographical area. As at 10 February 2020, 40,553 confirmed cases including 910 deaths have been reported worldwide with an increasing number of cases being reported in Europe [3] . So far, instances of secondary spread from international travellers have been limited, but clusters of human-tohuman transmission have been reported involving persons with close contact to confirmed cases [4] . A key knowledge gap is the efficiency of community transmission of 2019-nCoV, including the contribution of mild or asymptomatic cases. On 30 January 2020, the Word Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) because of these uncertainties, the ongoing seeding of the virus internationally, and the need for preparedness across the world in order to track and control the epidemic. WHO highlighted the crucial role of early detection of cases to interrupt virus spread and emphasised that countries need to put in place strong measures to detect and laboratory-confirm cases early [5] . Here, we assessed the required expertise and diagnostic capacity in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries."
38871,Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) antagonizes interferon-β production via blocking IPS-1 and RIG-I,"Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), a newly discovered coronavirus, is an enveloped, positive and single-stranded sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae and the genus Alphacoronavirus (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018a) . SADS-CoV is considered to be the causative agent of the fatal swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS) with clinical manifestations of severe, acute diarrhea and rapid weight loss in piglets, which caused significantly economic losses and seriously affected the development of the porcine industry in China (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018a) . As a newly emerged coronavirus, recent researches of SADS-CoV have been mainly focused on clinical diagnosis, molecular epidemiology, evolution and animal models (Fu et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018a, b; Xu et al., 2019) . To our knowledge, interactions between SADS-CoV and the host innate immune response is unknown, and detailed information on it is yet to be obtained."
