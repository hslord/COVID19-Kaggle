118,Comparison of ascites production for monoclonal antibodies in BALB/c and BALB/c-derived cross-bred mice,"It has been observed that male BALB/c mice produce greater quantities of ascitic fluid compared to the females (Brodeur et al., 1984) . In the cross-bred mice no such correlation between sex and yield was seen, indicating the possibility of using both male and female mice. This implies a more economical use of all animals from a litter of MF1/x mice, rather than just the males as is normal with BALB/c mice. The mean volume of ascitic fluid harvested from the three strains also shows that the MF1/x produce up to twice as much fluid as the BALB/c strain. This suggests that only half the number of mice is needed to generate the same volume of fluid as the BALB/c strain. This represents not only a more ethical usage of mice since fewer mice are required but is also advantageous in that less time, media and culture vessels are needed to grow the necessary hybridoma cells. Alternatively, one might use the same number of cross-bred mice as the BALB/c mice resulting in a larger volume of fluid. The result of this would be a long-lasting reserve of that particular ascites obviating the necessity for repeated use of more mice to generate further fluid. The advantage of this latter course is that one could be relatively certain that the antibody one is using remains constant in terms of titre and specificity."
1878,CHAPTER 28 Coronaviridae,"The prototype of the family, avian infectious brochitis virus, is one of the most infectious of all viruses, and causes an acute respiratory disease which in young chicks can cause very high mortality. Outbreaks can be explosive, involving nearly every bird in the flock at about the same time, because of respiratory transmission and a very short incubation period. In many ways, transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine and mouse hepatitis virus behave similarly, affecting young animals most severely, spreading very quickly to all animals at risk, and causing major economic losses before control strategies can be put into place. 505 Enteritis a Corona viruses have been associated with infections of the respiratory, enteric, and central nervous systems in monkeys, rats, rabbits, and other species."
1934,Chapter 1 Agents of Emerging Infectious Diseases,"The Challenge of Developing Vaccines against Emerging and Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases astronomically. As an example, a random sample of seawater near Bermuda yielded DNA sequences never known before. The most accepted definition of an emerging and re-emerging infectious disease is "" a disease that has newly appeared in the population or has existed previously, but is rapidly increasing in incidence and geographic range. "" Another widely cited definition is a "" new emerging or drug resistant infection whose incidence in humans has increased within the last two decades, or whose incidence threatens to increase in the near future. "" Strictly speaking all infectious diseases have "" emerged "" at one time or another. Thus, the definitions are rather arbitrary. The emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum as human pathogens probably occurred within the last few tens of thousands of years. Other pathogens required rather large human populations interacting closely so that human -human transmission would occur such as with measles and smallpox viruses. HIV probably made the jump to humans 60 -75 years ago. Emerging infections are further classified by others as newly emerging, re-emerging/resurging, and deliberately emerging. The factors involved in the process of emergence and re-emergence are extremely complex and have to do with the microbes themselves, the environment, and the hosts, a triad well known to any scientist who works in the field of infectious agents. The Convergence Model tries to explain all factors that affect the host -microbe interaction. This interaction is affected by interlocking domains, namely genetic and biologic factors, ecologic factors, physical environmental factors, and social, political and economic factors."
1934,Chapter 1 Agents of Emerging Infectious Diseases,"The principles that would determine the priority of development of vaccines would more logically be driven by public health concerns than merely financial return on investment. At the top of the list of criteria would be the severity of illness and incidence or threatened increase in incidence of the disease. Consideration of the severity of illness would include the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic infections, case-fatality ratio, incidence and nature of permanent sequelae, duration and medical costs of the illness in survivors, and other societal and economic impacts of the disease. Some diseases that would merit consideration for vaccine development on the criteria of disease severity and incidence include infections that currently occur nearly exclusively in developing countries such as Lassa fever, RVF, Ebola HF, louse-borne typhus, scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis."
2427,Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus,The disease was first reported in the United States (11) . Vaccines were developed in the 1950s and the economic impact diminished. 
2636,Chapter 18 Family Arteriviridae,"PRRSV is an economically important virus that made its appearance in the United States in 1987. The virus is found in both farm-raised and wild pigs. Once introduced into a naïve herd the virus most often spreads by direct contact but can also be spread by the aerosol route. The virus can be introduced into a herd via infected animals, semen, or contaminated fomites."
2636,Chapter 18 Family Arteriviridae,"• To date no arterivirus has been isolated from humans. EAV and PRRSV are economically important animal pathogens. SHFV and related monkey arteriviruses seem to cause little disease in their ""natural hosts"" but can cause fatal hemorrhagic fever on cross-species transmission. • EAV can cause a long-term persistent infection in stallions. However castrating stallions allows the infection to be cleared indicating a link to the hormone testosterone. The molecular mechanism by which testosterone facilities viral persistence is unknown."
2736,Chapter 11 Structural Insight Into the Viral 3C-Like Protease Inhibitors: Comparative SAR/QSAR Approaches,"In early 2003, about 8500 people were diagnosed across the world with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Among them, almost 800 died due to its first outbreak. The disease was broken out and turned into an epidemic in Guangdong of South China. Two cases of SARS infections were noticed in Taiwan and Singapore due to improper handling of the samples in the research laboratory. During April 2004, a ""mini outbreak"" of infections took place in a research laboratory of Beijing that, in turn, led to a chain of infections across three generations. Fortunately, the total number of SARS-infected people was only nine that time. This incidence threatens us about the mini outbreaks of SARS globally at any time (Anand et al., 2005) . The SARS is caused by the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that belongs to the family of Coronaviridae. This family also includes viruses, such as feline infectious peritonitis virus, murine hepatitis virus, bovine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), as well as human coronavirus 229E . The SARS is considered as a global threat to the health (Khan, 2013; Perlman and Netland, 2009) . Moreover, water and food-borne viral gastroenteritis may be caused by the noroviruses that belong to the family Calciviridae (Atmar, 2010; Patel et al., 2009) . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop small molecule antiviral drugs to combat these viruses. The picornavirus belongs to the family of viruses namely Picornaviridae, Calciviridae, and Coronaviridae (Mandadapu et al., 2013a) . A number of pathogeneses in human may occur due to these viruses leading to economic and medical burden. For example, human rhinovirus (HRV) is the major reason 318 Viral Proteases and Their Inhibitors for upper respiratory tract infection (Ren et al., 2012; Turner and Couch, 2007; Winther, 2011) whereas nonpolio enteroviruses are responsible for symptomatic infections with 10-15 million cases per year in United States (McMinn, 2012; Solomon et al., 2010) . Depending on the similarity of the polycistronic organization of the genome, common and posttranscriptional strategies along with the conserved region of domain homology in viral proteins, the virus families are related phylogenetically though these families are not related morphologically (Anand et al., 2005; Cavanagh, 1997; Cowley et al., 2000) . Coronavirus is found to be responsible for causing a number of diseases not only in human but also in animals, though the human coronavirus has not been taken into account seriously before the SARS outbreak (Anand et al., 2005) . Human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 and 229E may be responsible for illness in the upper portion of the respiratory tract along with common cold-like conditions (Myint, 1995) . The HCoV 229E is the only strain till date that can be cultured in cell culture technique efficiently. The symptoms of SARS include rigor, malaise, high degree of fever, cough, headache, and dyspnoea. The symptoms may also lead to produce interstitial infiltrates in lungs that may be treated through ventilation and intubation . Not only the lungs but also other organs may be affected by SARS infection (such as liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract). Therefore, the SARS infection may be treated as a cause of systemic infection. Face-to-face contacts may be supposed to be the reason for transmission of the pathogen though other routes are also possible. A number of inhibitors against SARS-CoV 3CL pro and HRV 3C pro were reported and the process of development of new antivirals against this class has been continued for a decade. In the present report, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) techniques have been explored to understand the relation between the SARS-CoV 3CL pro and HRV 3C pro enzyme inhibitory activity with the physicochemical and structural properties of these inhibitors developed till now. This approach may be a useful strategy to design and develop novel and potential SARS-CoV 3CL pro and HRV 3C pro inhibitors to combat the dreadful viral infections. and the sequence of genomic structure (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) ."
2811,Chapter 3 Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Poultry: Molecular Epidemiology and Factors Leading to the Emergence and Reemergence of Novel Strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus that causes an acute and highly contagious disease in chickens. The virus can cause substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. It can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause nephritis (Cavanagh, 1997) . IBV is the prototype species of the Coronavirus family, Gamma coronavirus genus, classified in the order Nidovirales, and it is the type species of the genus coronavirus of the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Cook et al., 2012) . Infectious bronchitis (IB) was first observed by Schalk and Hawn (1931) in North Dakota in the United States in 2-to 3week-old chickens. However, the nature of the infectious agent was not determined at that time and was assumed that IB was mainly a disease of young chickens. Hence, the disease was named ""infectious bronchitis of young chicks."" Five years later, it was demonstrated that the causative agent of this disease is a virus, which was named IBV (Beach and Schalm, 1936) . Since that initial discovery, many different serotypes, defined by neutralizing antibodies, and genetic types, based on the deduced amino acid sequence (from the nucleic acid sequence) of the spike gene, have been described around the world (El-Houadfi et al., 1986; Jackwood et al., 1997) ."
2811,Chapter 3 Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Poultry: Molecular Epidemiology and Factors Leading to the Emergence and Reemergence of Novel Strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"For logistics and economic reasons, some commercially available live attenuated IBV vaccines have been combined with other virus vaccines such as those against Newcastle disease virus, Marek's disease virus, and infectious bursal disease virus. However, it is not clear whether the combination may influence immune response to the combined antigen (Vagnozzi et al., 2010) , and if excess IBV component is present, IBV may interfere with other virus response such as NDV response (Thornton and Muskett, 1975) ."
4971,Infectious bronchitis virus in different avian physiological systems—A field study in Brazilian poultry flocks,"Infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious viral disease that may be associated with multi-systemic clinical signs (respiratory, renal, enteric, and reproductive) and reduced production in poultry commercial flocks. Besides these, airsacculitis due to co-infection with Mycoplasma or Escherichia coli is responsible for the condemnation of a large number of carcasses in slaughterhouses, generating great economic impact on the poultry industry (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family and has a single-strand positive sense RNA genome with approximately 27 kb. The IBV has 4 structural proteins: nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope, and spike (S), and this last protein is cleaved in the S1 and S2 subunits after translation (Cavanagh, 2007) . The S gene is highly polymorphic and is the main responsible for the antigenic variation of the virus ."
4977,Protective effects of hypericin against infectious bronchitis virus induced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species in chicken embryo kidney cells,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the Coronaviridae family (Cook et al., 2012) , causes mild-to-acute respiratory disease in chickens (Benyeda et al., 2009; Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019) . IBV infects chickens via the respiratory tract, from which it can spread to other epithelial tissues. Therefore, IBV not only injures the respiratory tract, but also causes damage to the digestive system and urogenital system, such as the proventriculus, kidney, ovary, and oviduct, resulting in respiratory disease, interstitial nephritis, and dysplasia of the oviduct (Zhong et al., 2016) . IBV has led to severe economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. It has been demonstrated that IBV not only causes direct loss due to high mortality, secondary bac-terial infection, poor meat production, and egg quality, but also indirect losses arises from increasing drug costs and vaccination in IBV prevention (Liang et al., 2019) ."
5125,Antiviral effect of lithium chloride on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in vitro,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the predominant cause of severe enteropathogenic diarrhea in swine, and causes substantial economic losses in the pig industry. Re-emergence of epidemic PED indicates that PEDV is effectively able to escape from the current vaccination protocols, biosecurity and control systems (Jung and Saif, 2015) . Vaccination is a fundamental strategy for controlling and eradicating PED during epidemic or endemic outbreaks, but the efficacy is limited (Baek et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2015) . Until now there is no recorded clinically effective antiviral chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of disease caused by PEDV, even several compounds were demonstrated having antiviral activity in PEDV-infected Vero cells (Deejai et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2015; Kwon et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2009) . So it is important to develop an effective strategy against PEDV infection."
6314,Wet markets—a continuing source of severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza?,"Where next? Will SARS reappear? This question confronts public-health officials worldwide, particularly infectious disease personnel in those regions of the world most affected by the disease and the economic burden of SARS, including China, Taiwan, and Canada. Will the virus re-emerge from wet markets or from laboratories working with SARS CoV, or are asymptomatic infections ongoing in human beings? Similar questions can be asked about a pandemic of influenza that is probably imminent. Knowledge of the ecology of influenza in wet markets can be used as an early-warning system to detect the reappearance of SARS or pandemic influenza. coronavirus (CoV) and wet markets as a possible source of the original outbreak. These researchers isolated a novel coronavirus from Himalayan palm civets (Paguna larvata) found in live-animal markets in Guangdong and provided serological evidence of infection of other animals (raccoon dogs, Nyctereutes procuyoinboides) and human beings in the markets. The animal isolates were different from the human SARS CoV in that they had an additional 29-nucleotide sequence not found in the human isolates (figure 2). WHO has had a task force working with Chinese authorities to develop strategies to define the ecology of SARS CoV. At the October, 2003, meeting Options to Control Influenza, in Okinawa, Japan, reports of replication of SARS CoV with disease signs in primates, 15 ferrets and cats, 16 and mice 17 provide animal models for vaccine and antiviral development, but suggest a wider host range in nature. After the identification of SARS-like CoV in civet cats, 14 civets were banned from wet markets in China but are again now available. Customer demand has driven the price for civet cats up to US$200, making it likely that such animals could be obtained whether or not they were banned. We lack information on the transmissibility of the SARS CoV-like virus in animals, the mode of transmission (oral, faecal), the role of intermediate hosts (eg, pigs and quail for influenza), environmental stability, and serological screening at the human-animal interface."
6725,Characterization of the interaction between recombinant porcine aminopeptidase N and spike glycoprotein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), characterized by vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration, has caused huge economic losses to the global pork industry [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Its causative agent, PED virus (PEDV), was an Alpha-coronavirus. Previous studies showed that a porcine receptor APN (pAPN) mediated PEDV infection [31] [32] [33] [34] and its density appeared to be an important factor in contributing to the virus efficient infection [35] . PEDV S1-CTD (residues 505-629) was further demonstrated to interact with pAPN ectodomain (residues 63-963) [36] . Interestingly, a few recent studies show that pAPN is not the functional receptor for PEDV infection [37, 38] . However, there is a lack of direct demonstration of the interaction between pAPN and PEDV S protein to clarify this discrepancy."
6856,Cost-effectiveness of transfusion of platelet components prepared with pathogen inactivation treatment in the United States,"When faced with the decision of whether to adopt new treatment strategies such as the IBS, health care policy makers must balance the competing interests of public safety and efficient use of health care resources. Although an improvement in the overall safety of platelet transfusions may result from the use of the IBS for platelets, the benefits of such a system presumably would be achieved at an extra cost. Cost-effectiveness analysis-assessing the net changes in costs and outcomes of medical interventions-has become an accepted method for the comparison of medical interventions and the guidance of decisions on the most efficient use of health care resources. l4 Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive economic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of using the IBS for platelets for AP and PC versus untreated AP and PC in the United States in patient populations in which platelets are commonly transfused."
6856,Cost-effectiveness of transfusion of platelet components prepared with pathogen inactivation treatment in the United States,"All data used in this analysis were summarized from existing published sources (primarily indexed in MEDLINE) and data on file at Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Chicago, Illinois) and Cerus Corporation (Concord, California). A literaturebased decision-analytic model was developed to assess the economic costs and clinical outcomes associated with the use of AP and PC treated with the IBS for platelets (AP + IBS and PC + IBS). The current analysis expanded on the previ- (Table I) .'5x1""- 23 A decision tree ( Figure 1 ) was constructed for patients receiving AP + IBS versus AP without IBS. An identical decision tree was constructed for analysis of PC + IBS versus PC without IBS. The baseline model included the current risks of infection with HIV, HCV, HBV, HTLV-1, or bacterial agents for each plateletdonor exposure. The model simulated subsequent transfusion-related events and outcomes, as well as events that would occur naturally; patients may experience morbidity and mortality due to several causes (eg, their underlying disease, transfusion-related complications, general mortality of populations of same age and sex)."
6856,Cost-effectiveness of transfusion of platelet components prepared with pathogen inactivation treatment in the United States,"Clinical outcomes resulting from underlying disease and transfusion-related complications were assigned a treatment cost and utility Life expectancy estimates were calculated using the declining exponential approximation of life expectancy method24%25 and took into consideration competing mortality from disease-specific and naturally occurring causes. The excess annual mortality rates and QALY weights (utility) for the study populations are presented in Table I . The direct medical costs attributable to the use of AP + IBS and PC + IBS (as well as the present value of future costs attributable to treating transfusion-related complications) were incorporated in the baseline model. No indirect costs (eg, work productivity losses) were considered. Projected economic costs and health benefits in future years were discounted at 3% per annum, consistent with current practice."
6856,Cost-effectiveness of transfusion of platelet components prepared with pathogen inactivation treatment in the United States,"The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were sensitive to simultaneous changes to the multiple parameters listed (with a range) in Tables II to IV For instance, in pediatric ALL patients, results of Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the ICER of AP + IBS versus untreated AP was less than $2.0 million (without bacterial testing)/$5.7 million (with bacterial testing) in 50% of model runs, and less than $4.1 million (without bacterial testing)/$8.9 million (with bacterial testing) in 95% of model runs. For the other 3 patient populations, the ICERs of AP + IBS versus untreated AP were less than $4.4 million/ $14.2 million (hip arthroplasty), less than $4.9 million/$18.5 million (CABG), and less than $8.3 million/$32.1 million (NHL) in 50% of model runs, and less than $8.5/$22.0 million (hip arthroplasty), $9.4/$28.9 million (CABG), and $15.8/$49.9 million (NHL) in 95% of model runs. DISCUSSION The current analysis provided a comprehensive economic assessment of APs and PCs treated with the IBS for platelets. The decision-analytic model accounts for the morbidity and mortality associated with the patient's underlying condition, as well as that of transfusion-related complications. The model used the most recently published pathogen-transmission risks, subsequent transfusion-related outcomes, and treatment costs to assess the health benefit and cost-effectiveness of the IBS for platelets in patients who commonly receive platelet transfusions."
6856,Cost-effectiveness of transfusion of platelet components prepared with pathogen inactivation treatment in the United States,"The results of the present analysis indicated that the IBS for platelets was relatively more cost-effective for pediatric ALL patients and orthopedic patients, followed by CABG and NHL patients. Overall, this finding reflected the favorable short-term prognosis of pediatric ALL and orthopedic patients, because mortality and quality of life after treatment were relatively similar to those expected for normal populations. The anticipated life expectancy of pediatric ALL patients was also greater due to their younger age at the time of transfusion. In contrast, the NHL and CABG patient populations were associated with relatively higher first-year posttreatment mortality rates, reducing the potential benefits of avoidance of transfusion-related infections. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the model results were not significantly affected by changes in viral-transmission risks for which testing is currently performed. The benefits of the IBS for platelets were driven by TRS mortality due to bacterial contamination of platelets. Currently, bacterial contamination remains the most frequent infectious complication associated with platelet transfusions. 6 Although the adoption of bacterial testing in the United States in the near future is expected to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination and TRS mortality, residual risks will remain due to the limitations of bacterial testing systems. 26, 27 In such circumstances, the benefit of the IBS would actually be substantially reduced (as shown in the baseline scenario 2). However, the concurrent use of pathogen inactivation and bacterial testing is very unlikely A generalized use of the IBS would probably omit the need for bacterial testing. 56 . The mortality from bacterial contamination was directly modeled in the current analysis without consideration for nonfatal outcomes. The rationale for such an approach is as follows: (1) Varying clinical definitions of transfusion reactions have led to a number of differing reports of TRS incidence, such as the incidence of sepsis, mild/severe septic reactions, bacterial contamination, bacteria-related events, transfusion reactions, and so on, all of which lack a clear consensus of the true incidence-however, the cumulative mortality rate per million units has been consistently used in the literature to estimate the impact of TRS; (2) rates for nonfatal reactions are often underestimated because of underrecognition and underreporting '(j; (3) the economic impact of septic reactions (mild or severe) due to bacterial contamination is minimal and may be neglected due to the rare occurrence; and (4) focusing on the critical effect of TRS-patient mortalitymay simplify, as well as clarify, the model. The mortality rate due to bacterial contamination has been reported in several well-known studies.6-s,77 A surveillance study in the United States found cumulative death rates of 2.2 and 1.9 per million for AP and PC, respectively, based on data for the years 1998 to 2000.6 However, as with other surveillance studies (eg, US Food and Drug Administration surveillance for bacterial safety""), the fatality and incidence rates were underestimated because of limitations of surveillance study methodology 6,77 A study conducted in France8 with a matched casecontrol study design reported that the cumulative death rates with PC and AP were 0.0 (95% CI, 0.0-35.8) and 7.1 (95% CI, 0.8-25.6) per million. A study at Johns Hopkins' revealed that the cumulative death rates during the 12-year period (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) were 15 per million for AP and 62 per million for PC. These rates were much higher than those from surveillance data,6,77 and may reflect the more aggressive ability of hospital-based studies to detect and report cases. Considering the limitations and strengths of each study, the death-per-million rates for bacterial contamination were conservatively calculated in our study as a weighted average by sample size 7,8. 10 per million for AP and 17 per million for PC. The Bacon study6 was excluded from these calculations because its underestimation was well recognized and the large sample size would bias the weighted average."
7086,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China,"Data were analyzed with SPSS Version 22.0. An analysis of descriptive statistics was conducted to illustrate the demographic and other selected characteristics of the respondents. A univariate analysis (Nonparametric test) was used to explore the significant associations between sample characteristics and the anxiety level during the COVID-19 epidemic (Abdellatif et al., 2020) . Statistically significant variables were screened and included in multivariate logistic regression analyses. The estimates of the strengths of associations were demonstrated by the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Spearman's correlation coefficient, r, was used to evaluate the association between COVID-19-related stressors, including economic and daily-life related stressors, as well as stressors related to delays in academic activities, and anxiety level. A two-tailed p < .05 was considered statistically significant."
7086,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China,"The results of the correlation analysis are shown in Table 4 . Worry about the economic influences of the epidemic were positively related to the levels of anxiety in college students (r = .327, P < .001). Moreover, worry about academic delays (r = .315, P < .001) and the influence of the epidemic on daily-life (r = .316, P < .001) were also moderately and positively correlated with the level of anxiety. In addition, the results suggested a negative association between social support and anxiety symptoms of college students during the COVID-19 outbreak. (r = -.151, P < .001). Table 4 Correlation analysis between the COVID-19-related stressors and college students' anxiety when facing the epidemic "
7086,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China,"Multivariate Logistic regression analysis suggested that living in urban areas, in contrast to rural areas, was conducive to reducing the anxiety of college students. This might be explained by the imbalance of economic, cultural, and educational resources between urban and rural areas. The urban economy is relatively prosperous and provides citizens with better material security (Shigemura et al., 2020) . Similarly, the sanitary conditions in cities are better than in towns and villages, which decreases the chances of surviving the virus. Cities also have excellent educational resources, and they have made great efforts to publicize knowledge on how to prevent the epidemic, which attracts attention to the measures taken to stop the epidemic . The stability of family income was also was a significant factor in students' experienced anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis, which could be explained by increased psychological and economic pressure (Liu, 2013) . Living with parents was another favorable factor against feeling anxious. Previous studies have indicated that the risk factors associated with emotional and anxiety disorders in adults include the death of parents in childhood, not living with parents, and parents' psychological problems and mental illnesses (Woodgate et al.,2020; Gentili et al., 2020) , which are consistent with the results of this study. Relatives or acquaintances being infected with COVID-19 was an independent risk factor in college students' anxiety about the epidemic, which might be related to the high contagiousness of the new coronavirus pneumonia (World Health Organization, 2020; Song et al., 2019) . Consistent with our hypothesis, the COVID-19-related stressors, which include economic stressors, effects on daily-life, and academic delays, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms of Chinese college students during the epidemic. Similar studies (Kernan, 2019) have indicated that in addition to the national health situation, the epidemic will also have a significant impact on the economy of the country and individuals. Because of the outbreak, some families will lose their source of income, and students might feel anxious about paying their tuition fees (Peng et al., 2012) . In China, the government took measures, including travel warnings and bans, and extending the national holidays to control the outbreak, which inevitably disrupted routine life and resulted in anxiety. In the mainland China and Hong Kong, all primary and secondary schools were closed, and universities were either postponing classes until March 2020 or were using distant/remote learning methods (Kwok et al., 2020) . These measures undoubtedly have a specific impact on the education and the growth of students. Finally, social support was negatively correlated with the anxiety of college students, which is consistent with previous findings (Thompson et al., 2016; . Social support not only reduces the psychological pressure during the epidemics but also changes the attitude regarding social support and help-seeking methods. This result suggests that effective and robust social support is necessary during public health emergencies (Bai et al., 2005) ."
7086,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China,"About 24.9% of college students have experienced anxiety because of this COVID-19 outbreak. Living in urban areas, living with parents, having a steady family income were protective factors for college students against experienced anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, having a relative or an acquaintance infected with COVID-19 was an independent risk factor for experienced anxiety. The COVID-19-related stressors that included economic stressors, effects on daily-life, and academic delays were positively associated with the level of anxiety symptoms of Chinese college students during the epidemic, whereas social support was negatively correlated with their anxiety."
7170,Age-dependent variation in innate immune responses to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection in suckling versus weaned pigs,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric coronavirus (genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) causing significant morbidity and mortality in suckling pigs. PEDV was first diagnosed in the USA in May, 2013 (Stevenson et al., 2013) and has spread throughout the USA and was also reported in Mexico and Canada (Vlasova et al., 2014) . The estimated annual economic losses in the US from PEDV is $900 million to $1.8 billion (Paarlberg, 2014) . PEDV causes severe enteric disease in suckling pigs (Chen et al., 2014; Stevenson et al., 2013) , but milder disease in older weaned pigs . This is similar to earlier observations for another enteric coronavirus infection of pigs, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) (Saif et al., 1994) . Therefore, similar to TGE virus (TGEV) infection, biofeedback of intestinal contents of affected pigs to older pigs to build herd immunity is considered as an important method to reduce losses from PEDV (Jung and Saif, 2015) . Viral infections induce both innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity involves production of cytokines and interferons as well as recruitment of innate immune cells such as http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.09.006 0165-2427/© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells (Rouse and Sehrawat, 2010) . The innate immune response plays a significant role in controlling primary viral infections and in development of adaptive immune responses (Aoshi et al., 2011; Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002) . NK cells are innate immune cells that display cytotoxic action against virus infected host cells and tumor cells (Campbell and Hasegawa, 2013; Herberman et al., 1975; Trinchieri, 1989) and thus play an important initial role in containing the viral infection. NK cells are also a major source of certain cytokines such as IFN␥ and TNF␣ (Fauriat et al., 2010; Vivier et al., 2008) . They play a key role in initial clearance of infection in viral diseases (Brandstadter and Yang, 2011) ."
7437,Specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for detection and quantitation of turkey coronavirus RNA in tissues and feces from turkeys infected with turkey coronavirus,"Turkey coronaviral enteritis, due to turkey coronavirus (TCoV) infection, causes atrophic enteritis, decreased weight gain, increased mortality and uneven flock growth in the turkeys leading to significant economic loss in the turkey industry. The occurrence of turkey coronaviral enteritis is still reported in many states of the U.S. There are no effective vaccine and treatment available for prevention and treatment of the disease. Therefore, rapid detec-tion, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV are very critical to monitor and control TCoV infection in the turkey flocks."
7491,A new approach for diagnosis of bovine coronavirus using a reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay,"Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an important pathogen of livestock causing enteric disease in newly born calves (neonatal calf diarrhea), and adult cattle (winter dysentery) (Clark, 1993) . The virus is also implicated in respiratory tract infections of growing calves and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle (Saif, 2010; Storz et al., 2000) . Some BCoV virus strains may also be responsible for simultaneous enteric and respiratory tract infections (Decaro et al., 2008a) . Although BCoV infections have a high morbidity that may reach 100%, it rarely causes death. However, the economic losses are substantial in dairy and beef farms due to sudden and dramatic reduction in milk production and loss of body weight (Svensson et al., 2003; Traven et al., 2001) ."
7539,Evaluation of two singleplex reverse transcription-Insulated isothermal PCR tests and a duplex real-time RT-PCR test for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine deltacoronavirus,"PEDV was first identified in England in the 1970s and has since spread to other European and Asian countries (Song and Park, 2012) . In October 2010, the PEDV strains circulating in China were reported to have become more virulent than classical PEDV strains, with some causing up to 100% morbidity and high mortality in suckling piglets (Li et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012) . In April 2013, PEDV emerged in United States (U.S.) swine and caused severe illness and high mortality in piglets (Stevenson et al., 2013) . Sequence analyses revealed that the U.S. virulent PEDVs (U.S. PEDV prototype strain) are most genetically similar to the Chinese virulent PEDV strain AH2012 Huang et al., 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013) . In January 2014, a mildly virulent PEDV variant was identified in the U.S. that had insertions and deletions in the spike gene (U.S. S-INDEL-variant strain) compared to the virulent U.S. PEDV prototype strain (Chen et al., 2016a; Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014b) . Since its emergence in the U.S. in April 2013, PEDV has spread rapidly across the country and resulted in the estimated death of 8 million pigs in the first year, causing economic losses of $900 million to $1.8 billion (Paarlberg, 2014) . In addition, PEDV has recently also emerged or re-emerged in China, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Belgium, France and Portugal (Grasland et al., 2015; Mesquita et al., 2015; Pasick et al., 2014; Puranaveja et al., 2009; Song and Park, 2012; Stadler et al., 2015; Theuns et al., 2015; Vlasova et al., 2014; Vui et al., 2015) . Currently, PEDV remains a significant threat to the global swine industry."
7571,A novel multiplex PCR-electronic microarray assay for rapid and simultaneous detection of bovine respiratory and enteric pathogens,"Several previous studies documented the development of PCR-based assays for detection of pathogens associated with bovine respiratory and enteric diseases. However, most studies target either a single or a limited number of pathogens. Given the multifactorial nature and frequent involvement of multiple pathogens, a comprehensive assay that could simultaneously detect multiple pathogens is essential for rapid diagnosis and effective control of these economically significant diseases."
7571,A novel multiplex PCR-electronic microarray assay for rapid and simultaneous detection of bovine respiratory and enteric pathogens,"In summary, new pathogen detection assays based on multiplex PCR and automated electronic microarray have been developed for comprehensive detection of bacterial, viral, and protozoal pathogens that are associated with BRDC and BED. With further clinical validation and subsequent deployment to veterinary diagnostic laboratories, these assays could be used for the rapid identification of pathogens in disease outbreaks and facilitate quick and accurate decision making for the control and treatment of economically important diseases of cattle. Furthermore, these assays could be very effective tools in epidemiological studies as well as screening of healthy animals to identify carriers, and those that may potentially develop BRD or BED. These assays are currently being adapted for use on a fully-integrated and fully-automated ""sample-to-answer"" system which reduces costs associated with labour, decreases turnaround time, and minimizes potential cross-contamination due to user intervention."
7804,IFN-lambda preferably inhibits PEDV infection of porcine intestinal epithelial cells compared with IFN-alpha,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteropathogenic alpha coronavirus and causes swine disease with huge economic relevance (Madson et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Zhang and Yoo, 2016; review) . PEDV primarily infects small intestinal epithelial cells in vivo, and infection causes pronounced villous atrophy that results in an acute malabsorption syndrome with symptoms of watery diarrhea, vomiting and anorexia in pigs of all ages (Li et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014) . PEDV infection causes high morbidity and mortality, particularly in newborn piglets, which results in a significant economic loss in the pig industry (Jung et al., 2015; Li et al., 2012) . Although there are several commercial PEDV vaccines available in China, the PEDV endemic has persisted in China since 2011 (Chen et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012) . Therefore, the development of anti-PEDV therapeutics is urgently needed. IFN-L has been shown to inhibit replication of many viruses in vitro and in vivo Hernandez et al., 2015; Sommereyns et al., 2008) . However, there are no reports regarding whether porcine IFN-L inhibits the coronavirus PEDV."
7804,IFN-lambda preferably inhibits PEDV infection of porcine intestinal epithelial cells compared with IFN-alpha,"Interferons are one of the most important molecules of innate immunity in response to viral infection. IFN-L is increasingly being shown to play a pivotal role in inhibiting viral infections at mucosal surfaces. However, there is no information available about whether porcine IFN-L inhibits swine enteric pathogenic coronaviruses. PEDV is an alpha coronavirus that causes economically significant swine diseases. In this study, we investigated the relative contribution of porcine IFN-L toward controlling the infection of PEDV in vitro."
7960,A double-blind block randomized clinical trial on the effect of zinc as a treatment for diarrhea in neonatal Holstein calves under natural challenge conditions,"Considerable economic losses may be incurred from neonatal diseases during calf rearing. In 2006, 8% of pre-weaned heifers and 2% of weaned heifers died primarily due to diarrhea and other gastrointestinal illnesses (NAHMS, 2010) . Similarly in pediatrics, diarrhea is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years in developing countries and is estimated to cause 3 million deaths annually (Bhutta et al., 2000; Hoque et al., 2009) . In 2004, based on numerous randomized clinical trials, the World Health Organization recommended zinc supplementation of oral rehydration solutions to decrease the duration and severity of infant diarrhea (Bhutta et al., 1999; Faruque et al., 1999; Penny et al., 1999) . Infants with diarrhea for more than 10 days had significantly lower serum zinc levels compared to healthy infants or infants with other non-gastrointestinal illnesses (Naveh et al., 1982) , suggesting gastrointestinal loss of zinc (Hoque et al., 2009 ). Zinc-supplemented ORS also resulted in increased recovery rates, reduced mortality and a reduction in use of antibiotics (Bhandari et al., 2008; Bhutta et al., 2000 Bhutta et al., , 1999 . Although the exact underlying mode of action of zinc is still not known, (Hoque et al., 2009 ) a mucosal-protective role, enhanced cell-mediated immunity, and modification of intra-luminal electrolyte secretion and absorption mechanisms have been proposed (Atia and Buchman, 2009; Fischer Walker et al., 2009; Hoque et al., 2009) . Similar benefits of zinc-supplemented ORS on diarrhea in calves could significantly impact the economics and sustainability of the production system by reducing antibiotic use for treatment of calf diarrhea. Zinc studies have demonstrated its beneficial effects in piglets and rats, and on calf growth and fetal development (Graham et al., 2010 (Graham et al., , 1984 Owusu-Asiedu et al., 2003) . However, the therapeutic use of zinc in calves with diarrhea has not been studied. A comparison of inorganic and organic formulations of zinc such as zinc oxide (ZO) and zinc methionine (Met), respectively, is warranted because of differences in zinc bioavailability (Wedekind et al., 1992) . A greater effectiveness of an inorganic zinc formulation in treating calf diarrhea compared to an organic formulation may be evidence of zinc's local intra-luminal mode of action given its poor absorption in the intestines (absorption coefficient of ZO = 0.12 compared to 0.40 for zinc Met) (Cousins, 1985) . On the other hand, if zinc Met is found to be more effective than ZO in treating diarrhea this may be evidence for a systemic mode of action given the greater bioavailability of zinc Met compared to ZO. In addition, because zinc is an antagonist of copper (NRC, 2001) , a comprehensive assessment of trace minerals is necessary when administering zinc to calves."
7966,Evaluation of a protocol to reduce the incidence of neonatal calf diarrhoea on dairy herds,"In the USA, diarrhoea in neonatal calves accounts for more than 50% of unweaned dairy heifer deaths (USDA, 2010) . Economic losses are also due to reduced growth rates, treatment costs and time spent caring for the affected calves (Anderson et al., 2003; Ok et al., 2009) . Moreover, NCD creates a problem in terms of animal welfare and farmer distress (Lorenz et al., 2011; Smith, 2012) . The herd veterinarian is the most adequate person to advice farmers how to treat and how to prevent NCD (Smith, 2012) ."
7966,Evaluation of a protocol to reduce the incidence of neonatal calf diarrhoea on dairy herds,"Neonatal calf diarrhoea is a disease with a major impact on the economic viability of cattle herds worldwide and can be triggered by both infectious and non-infectious causes. The present study focused on prevention of infectious causes of NCD with main emphasis on E. coli, rotaand coronavirus and C. parvum. Rotavirus and C. parvum were the 2 most common enteropathogens found in faeces of calves in the present study, confirming data reported worldwide (Ok et al., 2009; Bartels et al., 2010; Izzo et al., 2011) ."
7993,"Prevalence, phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of porcine deltacoronavirus in Henan province, China","Piglet diarrhea is an important disease that threatens the pig industry development, and the coronaviruses are currently the main pathogens that caused piglet diarrhea. PDCoV is a novel swine intestine coronavirus and has caused serious economic losses for pig industry (Hu et al., 2015) . So far, PDCoV has been reported in several countries and the pathogenicity for this novel virus has been studied using the neonatal piglets (Wang et al., 2014a; Wang et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2016) . However, little regarding the molecular epidemiology of PDCoV has been reported in Henan province, a major pigraising region of China. In the present study, we investigated the PDCoV prevalence in the diarrheal pigs in different regions and analyzed the full-length genome sequence properties of PDCoV strains in Henan province, which might provide more insight about the pigs diarrhea outbreaks in China."
8259,Ribavirin efficiently suppresses porcine nidovirus replication,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a pathogenic macrophage-tropic arterivirus of pigs, is the etiological agent of acute respiratory illness in young piglets and reproductive failure in pregnant sows (Albina, 1997) . PRRSV primarily replicates in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and can establish persistent infection in lymphoid tissues of infected pigs that lasts for several months (Albina et al., 1994; Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995; Duan et al., 1997; Wills et al., 2003) . As a result, PRRSV infection results in suppression of normal macrophage functions and immune responses, which may render pigs susceptible to secondary bacterial or viral infections, leading to more severe disease than either agent alone (Allan et al., 2000; Feng et al., 2001; Harms et al., 2001; Wills et al., 2000) . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a pathogenic enterocyte-tropic coronavirus of swine, is the etiological agent of acute enteritis, which is characterized by lethal watery diarrhea followed by dehydration leading to death with a high mortality rate in suckling piglets (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980) . These two viruses, PRRSV and PEDV, are devastating porcine nidoviral pathogens that have still continued to plague swineproducing nations, causing tremendous economic losses to the global and Asian pork industries (Neumann et al., 2005; Pensaert and Yeo, 2006) ."
8259,Ribavirin efficiently suppresses porcine nidovirus replication,"To examine the effect of ribavirin on porcine nidovirus replication, PRRSV and PEDV were selected because they are important viral pathogens that economically affect the swine industry. Based on MTT assay, none of the doses of ribavirin tested in the present study caused detectable cell death of PAM-pCD163 and Vero cells (data not shown). PAM-pCD163 and Vero cells were pretreated with ribavirin at concentrations of 10-50 M or 10-200 M, respectively, or with DW as a vehicle control for 1 h prior to infection. Ribavirin was present during the entire period of infection. Viral production was initially measured by monitoring the cytopathic effect (CPE) after infection and confirmed by immunofluorescence using N protein-specific MAb at 48 hpi (Fig. 1) . In vehicle-treated control cells, visible CPE appeared at 24 hpi and became predominant by 48 hpi, and N-specific staining was clearly evident in many cell clusters, indicating infection and the spread of the virus to neighboring cells. In contrast, ribavirin had an obvious inhibitory effect on virus propagation. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, ribavirin significantly decreased virus-induced CPE and viral gene expression of PRRSV and PEDV at concentrations of ∼10 M and ∼50 M, respectively. N protein staining revealed that the number of cells expressing viral antigen, as quantified by N protein staining results, was also reduced during ribavirin treatment, resulting in a maximum of ∼80% inhibition in response to 50 M and 200 M for PRRSV and PEDV, respectively ( Fig. 1A and B) . Moreover, the effective doses for inhibiting 50% (ED 50 ) of the replication of PRRSV and PEDV were determined to be about 21 M and 73 M, respectively. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ribavirin efficiently suppresses the replication of porcine nidoviruses."
8259,Ribavirin efficiently suppresses porcine nidovirus replication,"The Nidovirales are an order of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with animal hosts, which synthesize a nested set of multiple sg mRNAs. This order includes three families Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, and Roniviridae, which have similar genome organization and replication strategy, but different virion morphology and genome length (Mayo, 2002; Lai et al., 2007; Snijder and Spaan, 2007) . Porcine nidoviruses are not only devastating viral pathogens to the pig population, but can also be applied as an animal virus model to study human or veterinary-important nidoviruses. Among these, despite tremendous efforts to control the diseases, PRRSV and PEDV have continuously plagued pigproducing countries, leading to significant economic impacts on the global or Asian swine industry, respectively. This is partially due to a lack of efficient vaccines capable of conferring full protection against viral infections and antiviral agents for treating porcine nidoviruses. Although ribavirin has an antiviral effect on a variety of DNA and RNA viruses (Sidwell et al., 1972) , its efficacy and mode of action on porcine nidovirus replication are currently unknown. The present study demonstrated that ribavirin also exerts very effective antiviral activity against PRRSV and PEDV in vitro, as indicated by ED 50 values of approximately 21 M (5.1 g/ml) and 73 M (17.8 g/ml), respectively. Ribavirin can potentially act via inhibition of various steps of the virus life cycle, including viral translation, genome or transcript capping, RNA synthesis, and progeny virus spread (Graci and Cameron, 2006) . Treatment of cells with ribavirin resulted in significant attenuation of postentry steps during the replication of porcine nidovirus, as determined by lower progeny production, diminished viral protein expression, and decreased synthesis of genomic RNA and sg mRNA. It was previously reported that the tier of murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) in the presence of ribavirin dropped about 10-fold after virus infection, but remained similar after 48 h of virus infection (Chang and George, 2007) . In this study, growth kinetics experiments also indicated that the reduced rate of nidoviral titers in the presence of ribavirin was found to be comparable between 24 and 48 hpi. Since ribavirin should be converted to its monophosphate active form (RMP) to exert antiviral activity, it appears that virus infection may disrupt the normal metabolic processes, leading to interference with the conversion of ribavirin (Parker, 2005) . Taken together, our data indicate that ribavirin potently elicits antiviral activity against PRRSV and PEDV in target cells."
8335,"Porcine deltacoronavirus infection: Etiology, cell culture for virus isolation and propagation, molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis","The family Coronaviridae can be genetically divided into the four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Woo et al., 2012) . Bats are the projected host for the gene source of Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses, while birds are the suspect host for Gammacoronaviruses and Deltacoronaviruses (Woo et al., 2012) . The other swine enteropathogenic coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), also belongs to Alphacoronavirus. Similar epidemiological, clinical, and pathological features among PDCoV, PEDV and TGEV have complicated their diagnosis, requiring differential laboratory tests . In the US, since 2013-2014, the newly emerged PEDV and PDCoV have spread nationwide and affected pigs alone or jointly, causing a high number of pig deaths and significant economic impacts and hindering the control of both viral infections in farms dually affected by these two viruses (Anon., 2014; Jung and Saif, 2015) . At present, differential diagnosis of PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV is critical to control the coronaviral epidemic diarrheas in US pig farms."
8336,Porcine epidemic diarrhea: A retrospect from Europe and matters of debate,"Much changed in 1976 when Wood (1977) from the Veterinary Investigation Centre in Norwich (England) described a new diarrheic syndrome. It differed from ED in that it now affected pigs of all ages, including neonatal and suckling pigs. Mortality was variable, restricted to young piglets and averaged around 30%. This new disease now resembled TGE more closely than ED did, but TGEV was again excluded using direct immunofluorescence on intestines and applying established serological techniques available for detection of anti-TGEV antibodies. Now, a differentiation with TGE on a clinical basis only became difficult, often impossible. This new syndrome was called ED2 to differentiate it from the 1971 ED1 where no baby pigs were involved. ED2 was economically much more important than ED1."
8336,Porcine epidemic diarrhea: A retrospect from Europe and matters of debate,"This new evolution to ED2 with the involvement of baby pigs and its larger economic impact yielded better opportunities for collecting material for etiological studies, for experimental reproduction of the disease and for the development of virological and serological techniques. In 1978, Chasey and Cartwright (1978) reported the detection of virus like particles, and Pensaert and Debouck (1978) described the isolation of a new coronavirus-like agent (CVLA) from diarrheic pigs, with both research groups succeeding in reproducing diarrhea in experimental pigs. Soon after the isolation of this new coronavirus, extensive pathogenesis studies were performed in colostrum deprived pigs with one of the Belgian isolates, designated coronavirus CV777, (isolated in month 7 of 1977) which became the prototype strain for PEDV in Europe (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980; Debouck et al., 1981) . ED2 was soon named ""porcine epidemic diarrhea"" (PED) caused by PED virus (PEDV) a denomination which still stands at present."
8336,Porcine epidemic diarrhea: A retrospect from Europe and matters of debate,"A point of debate in the PEDV evolution, particularly since its occurrence in Asia and its emergence the USA, is the arising of PEDV genetic variants influencing virulence. The history in Europe, here presented, allows to assume that ED2/PEDV was a variant of ED1 which had acquired tropism for intestinal enterocytes in neonatal pigs. This new tropism expanded and increased the virus virulence since a vulnerable age became affected and piglets mortality became an important economic aspect of the disease. Currently, two major PEDV variants are described in the USA upon routine genome analyses of USA isolates. The first, also called ""original US PEDV "", appears to be ""highly virulent"" while the second, the so called S-INDEL strains, standing for INsertions and DELetions in the S gene of the virus, are associated with mild(er) clinical outbreaks. Similar genotypic variants have been detected in Asia, the S-INDELs already before 2010 and the highly virulent since 2010. When adopting this genomic identification, it appears that CV777 is classified as a S-INDEL isolate apparently belonging to a different cluster compared to the US INDELs (Carvajal et al., 2015) . Considering the pathogenesis and virulence of the European prototype strain CV777 of the seventies as evaluated by the sites and degree of replication and the degree of villous atrophy, no real difference exists with the more recent highly virulent (original US PEDV) isolates from the USA. For example, the pig adapted C777 when experimentally inoculated in neonatal piglets, caused villous atrophy with villous length reduction from the normal value of 700-900 m to as low as 200-300 m throughout the small intestine and within 6-36 h after the start of the diarrhea Coussement et al., 1982) ."
8336,Porcine epidemic diarrhea: A retrospect from Europe and matters of debate,"As the eighties advanced, fewer outbreaks on breeding farms were seen even though the virus was still detected but the general economic impact of PED had become lower. In Belgium in 1992, 17 groups of feeder pigs from 15 commercial finishing herds, using the all in-all out production system, were examined for serocoversion to PEDV and TGEV. None of the groups seroconverted to TGEV while 7 seroconverted to PEDV with diarrhea observed in all 7 (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994) . In an Hungarian study published in 1996, 5.5% of 92 faecal samples from weaned pigs with diarrhea tested positively for PEDV (Nagy et al., 1996) ."
8336,Porcine epidemic diarrhea: A retrospect from Europe and matters of debate,"Interest from a disease and economic point of view became very low in Europe and no further research was performed on PED. Practically no serosurveys were carried out. A serological survey in sows from farrow to finish herds carried out in Belgium in 1996 revealed that gilts were positive for PEDV antibodies in only 2 of the 144 considered farms, and in 1997, 72 fattening farms were examined for PEV antibodies and none were positive (Pensaert, unpublished) ."
8339,Immune evasion of porcine enteric coronaviruses and viral modulation of antiviral innate signaling,"Coronavirus enteritis is a highly contagious viral disease in pigs characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration with a high mortality, especially in neonatal piglets less than 2 weeks of age. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a frequent cause for endemic and epidemic viral enteritis in neonates and older pigs (Kim et al., 2000; Laude et al., 1993) , and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has become a major concern in the swine industry in the US since its emergence in April 2013. As with TGEV, PEDV causes severe enteritis in newborn piglets but the mortality can be much higher and may reach up to 100% during epidemics (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980; Song and Park, 2012) . PED was first described in the UK in the early 1970s and has since become endemic in some parts of Europe. Highly virulent PEDV has emerged in Asia and subsequently in the US (Chen et al., 2014a,b; Marthaler et al., 2013; Mole, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013) . PEDV has since quickly spread to most states and as of April 2016, 36 states have become endemic for PEDV, raising a significant economic concern (www.aphis.usda. gov/animal-health/secd). PDCoV is a newly emerged swine enteric coronavirus causing enteritis and severe diarrhea in piglets, which was first described in a surveillance study 2012 in Hong Kong, China (Woo et al., 2012) . PDCoV is an additional enteric virus emerged in the US in February 2014 . PDCoV has been identified in the feces and intestinal samples of pigs experiencing severe diarrhea without PEDV and TGEV . Retrospective studies show that PDCoV has been present in the US at least since August 2013 (McCluskey et al., 2016; Sinha et al., 2015) . PDCoV has also spread to at least 20 states of the US (www. aphis.usda.gov/animal-health/secd), Korea, and China Lee and Lee, 2014) . PDCoV infection seems clinically milder with a lower death rate of 30-40% in neonates than typical PEDV infection , but co-infection with PEDV, TGEV, or porcine rotavirus is common and result in a severe form of disease (Marthaler et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014) . Clinical symptoms by PDCoV are reproducible in both gnotobiotic pigs and conventional pigs and present diarrhea accompanied by severe histopathological lesions such as villi atrophy in the absence of other pathogens Jung et al., 2015c; Ma et al., 2015) . Although the clinical signs and pathological lesions are indistinguishable among PEDV, TGEV, and PDCoV (Jung et al., 2014) , these coronaviruses are antigenically distinct and thus the cross-protection is absent (Lin et al., 2015) . Pathogenesis of these coronaviruses may include destruction of enterocytes and villous atrophy of the intestinal mucosa in the jejunum and ileum (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980; Jung et al., 2014) ."
8339,Immune evasion of porcine enteric coronaviruses and viral modulation of antiviral innate signaling,"Two emerging enteric coronaviruses, PEDV and PDCoV, have caused epidemic and endemic infections in pig populations in many countries and have become a major economic threat to the pork industry. The intestinal epithelial surface is the first line of defense to restrict the enteric viral infections, and both IFN-␣/␤ and IFNare important antiviral cytokines that viruses have evolved to counteract. For PEDV, at least 10 viral IFN-␣/␤ antagonists have been identified in our laboratory. Since enteric coronaviruses infect intestinal epithelial surface, several questions still remain to be answered (Fig. 2) . Firstly, whether PEDV and PDCoV selectively activate and/or modulate IFN-production and whether IFN-plays a protective role on the intestinal surface. Secondly, how different cell types such as IECs, pDCs, and IELs in the intestinal barrier induce different types of IFNs and function for mucosal defense. Thirdly, the intestinal epithelium constantly interacts with commensal bacteria and opportunistic viral infections, and thus IFN systems must be able to deal with these organisms without severe inflammation and tissue damages. Thus, better research models for cells and animals are needed to truly reflect viral evasions from innate immune defense. Lastly, specific cytokine mediators are produced in IECs, and how they respond to porcine enteric viral infections is of an additional interest."
8342,Cellular entry of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,"PED was not detected in swine until the 1970s. The first PED outbreak in swine was recognized in England in 1971. Seven years later the etiological agent was identified as a coronavirus and officially named as PEDV (Pensaert and De Bouck, 1978) . PED was prevalent throughout Europe causing sporadic, localized outbreaks in the 1980s, 1990s and in subsequent years (Martelli et al., 2008) . PED was first reported in Asia in 1982 and since then it has had an increasingly great economic impact on the Asian swine industry. Particularly since 2010, devastating outbreaks have been reported in China and other Asian countries causing up to 100% mortality in suckling piglets (Li et al., 2012; Puranaveja et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2012) . PEDV entered the United States (US) for the first time in April 2013 and this virulent strain rapidly spread across the US to 36 states, as well as to other countries in North-and South-America, including Canada (Pasick et al., 2014) , Mexico , the Dominican Republic, Colombia and Peru (Ojkic et al., 2015; Oka et al., 2014) . A less virulent PEDV strain has been detected in the US characterized by small genomic insertions and deletions (S INDEL strain) in the viral spike glycoprotein. Since 2014, PEDV has reemerged in Europe including Germany (Hanke et al., 2015) , Italy, Austria (Steinrigl et al., 2015) , The Netherlands, Belgium (Theuns et al., 2015) , Portugal (Mesquita et al., 2015) , France (Grasland et al., 2015) and Ukraine (Dastjerdi et al., 2015) ."
8343,"Evolution, antigenicity and pathogenicity of global porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains","At the end of 2010, pandemic porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) outbreaks occurred in China and caused large economic losses. Subsequently, starting in the spring of 2013, the pork industry in the United States (US) was also severely affected by this disease. A lack of protective lactogenic immunity in the US swine population (Stevenson et al., 2013) and PEDV antigenic variations between the traditional attenuated vaccine and current highly virulent PEDV field strains in Asia (Lin et al., 2015a,b) were major contributors to severe PED outbreaks. Therefore, the development of updated PEDV vaccines is urgently needed."
8343,"Evolution, antigenicity and pathogenicity of global porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains","2.2. Since 2010, highly virulent PEDV strains emerged in China and subsequently spread to other Asian countries, the Americas, and back into Europe Starting from October 2010, severe PEDV outbreaks occurred in the Chinese pig population and caused enormous economic losses (Sun et al., 2015a . Although PEDV vaccines based on classical PEDV strain CV777 were widely used in China, the mortality in neonatal piglets was high, reaching 50-100%, indicating the emergence of highly virulent PEDV variants."
8343,"Evolution, antigenicity and pathogenicity of global porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains","In April, 2013, the first highly virulent PEDV infections emerged in swine farms in the US (Stevenson et al., 2013) . By March 12, 2015, PEDV had spread to 36 US states, including the geographically separated state of Hawaii, and one US territory, Puerto Rico (https://www.aasv.org/Resources/PEDv/PEDvWhatsNew.php). In the first year, PEDV killed about 10% of the US swine population, accounting for deaths of 7 million pigs, and resulting in major economic losses to the US swine industry (http://www.dailykos. com/story/2014/4/27/1295143/-PEDv-virus-has-killed-10-of-U-S-pig-population-causing-spike-in-prices). The last large-scale outbreak in the US ended in the spring of 2014 (Jarvis et al., 2015) . By 2014, the highly virulent PEDV had spread to other countries in the Americas, including Canada, Mexico, and Columbia ."
8343,"Evolution, antigenicity and pathogenicity of global porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains","Fifth, pigs of all ages can be infected by the highly virulent PEDV, but pigs develop age-dependent resistant to PEDV disease Madson et al., 2014) . Experimental inoculation of 2-and 7-day-old CDCD piglets by a Japanese PEDV strain isolated in 1999 resulted in 100% morbidity and mortality. However, only mild diarrhea occurred in 2-and 4-week-old pigs and no clinical signs were observed in 8-and 12week old pigs (Shibata et al., 2000) . In our studies, morbidity was consistently 100% in the PC21A or PC22A-inoculated piglets and their contact-exposed sows (Lin et al., 2015a; Liu et al., 2015) . In our laboratories, a slower turnover rate of enterocytes and impaired lytic activity and IFN-gamma production by natural killer cells in 9-day-old nursing piglets being less than in 26-day-old were proposed as explanations for one of the mechanisms of age-dependent resistance to PEDV. However, the highly virulent PEDV strains caused severe growth retardation in weaned pigs and significant impairment in productivity, such as lower farrowing rates, lower total pigs and pigs born alive per litter and decreased nursing performance of sows (Goede and Morrison, 2016; Lin et al., 2016) , leading to the overall negative economic impacts on the pork industry."
8349,Efficient priming of CD4 T cells by Langerin-expressing dendritic cells targeted with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus spike protein domains in pigs,"E-mail address: xjmeng@vt.edu (X.-J. Meng). et al., 2013) . The disease mainly affects neonatal piglets often presented with watery diarrhea, vomiting, and 90-95% mortality in naïve populations (Stevenson et al., 2013) causing immense economic losses to the swine industries (Schulz and Tonsor, 2015) . The causative agent of the disease is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an alpha-coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978; Tobler et al., 1993) . PEDV encodes four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) (Brian and Baric, 2005) . PEDV S protein is a type I transmembrane protein. The extracellular portion of S protein contains major antigenic determinants, and is made up of three domains, N-terminal domain (NTD), S1 domain and S2 domain. The S1 and S2 domains contain potential virus neutralizing epitopes (Huang et al., 2013; Song and Park, 2012) . A recombinant, spike-based (NTD-S1) vaccine induces virus-neutralizing antibody responses in pregnant sows and protected their offspring from mortality (Oh et al., 2014) . However, the cellular immune responses of this protein subunit vaccine have not been determined. Recent studies showed that PEDV infection or vaccination enhanced the antigen presenting capabilities of porcine DCs in vitro and in vivo which subsequently stimulated T cell proliferation efficiently (Gao et al., 2015 (Gao et al., , 2016 . In mouse and monkey models, Human immunodeficiency virus gag antigens were targeted to specific dendritic cell (DC) subsets expressing c-type lectin receptors (CLRs) in order to generate effective cellular immune responses even at low antigenic doses (Trumpfheller et al., 2012) . More recently, we successfully targeted porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) antigen to a pig DC subset expressing DC-SIGN that effectively primed CD4 T cells in pigs at a low antigenic dose (Subramaniam et al., 2014) . However, the effects of antigen targeting to additional porcine CLRs are entirely unknown."
8361,Aminopeptidase N is not required for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus cell entry,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family (subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Alphacoronavirus) and causes mild to severe diarrheal disease in pigs. PEDV replicates efficiently in the small intestine and causes acute, severe atrophic enteritis inducing watery diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting, with particularly high mortality in sero-negative neonatal piglets (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980) . PEDV was first reported in feeder and grower pigs in England in 1971 (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978) . Subsequently, PEDV positive cases were reported in several other European countries. In Asia, PEDV was first identified in 1982, after which it remained endemic causing substantial economic losses to the pork industry (Song and Park, 2012) . Since 2010, a large-scale outbreak of PEDV was reported in China. The severe outbreak was characterized by 80-100% morbidity and 50-90% mortality among infected suckling piglets Sun et al., 2012) . Apart from some suspected cases in Canada in 1970s (Turgeon et al., 1980) , North America was free of PEDV until April 2013, when a severe outbreak started which spread rapidly across the United States, causing high mortalities among infected piglets and substantial economic losses (Chen et al., 2014; Cima, 2013; Huang et al., 2013) ."
8392,PEDV nsp16 negatively regulates innate immunity to promote viral proliferation,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious disease of pigs characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in swine of all ages, causing considerable economic losses worldwide each year (Song and Park, 2012; Rui-Qin et al., 2012; Pensaert and De Bouck, 1978) . The causative agent of the disease, PED virus (PEDV), is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to a porcine enteropathogenic alphacoronavirus (Kocherhans et al., 2001) . The PEDV genome is 28,000 nucleotides (nt) in length, containing seven known open reading frames (ORFs) . The genomic organization is a typical coronavirus with the characteristic gene order. PEDV genome has a 5′ cap and a poly (A) tail, encoding 17 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16, and ORF3) and four structural protein: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)."
8578,Adjuvant effects of mannose-binding lectin ligands on the immune response to infectious bronchitis vaccine in chickens with high or low serum mannose-binding lectin concentrations,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease of economic importance in the poultry industry with symptoms such as sneezing, tracheal rales, and coughing. Furthermore, IB may cause a decline in egg quality and production in layers (Raj and Jones 1997) . IB is caused by the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) which is highly able to genetically mutate and recombine. As a result, there is a continuous development of new strains throughout the world. Different strains can co-circulate within a region, and the severity of the disease varies from strain to strain and from flock to flock (Capua et al. 1999; Cavanagh 2007; Cook et al. 2012) . Consequently, applied vaccines sometimes provide insufficient protection, as vaccination with one strain of IBV may not be protective against other strains."

During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, the disease had a great impact on infection control measures. 5 In a simulation involving outbreaks of SARS, 2009 pandemic H1N1, and 1918"
9656,Manipulation of the infectious bronchitis coronavirus genome for vaccine development and analysis of the accessory proteins,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the single most economically costly infectious disease of domestic fowl in the UK, causing losses in both meat-type and commercial egg layer birds [1, 2] . Although live and inactivated vaccines have contributed immensely to the management of IB, 0264 control is suboptimal due to a number of factors, including inefficient application of vaccine and extensive antigenic variation [3] ; serotypes induce poor cross-protection [4] [5] [6] . The poultry industry is moving towards in ovo vaccination where possible. This has been achieved for Marek's disease. To date all IB vaccines have severely reduced hatching. We have two strategic goals. One, to modify the genome of our molecularly cloned cDNA of the Beaudette strain of IBV (non-pathogenic) to achieve optimum stimulation of protection whilst retaining its non-pathogenic phenotype in both chicks and 10-day-old embryos. Two, to swap the gene of the spike protein (S), which induces protective immunity, to make a vaccine appropriate for a prevailing serotype."
9824,Recombinant live attenuated avian coronavirus vaccines with deletions in the accessory genes 3ab and/or 5ab protect against infectious bronchitis in chickens,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an avian gammacoronavirus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales [1, 2] . It was first discovered in the United States in the 1930s [3] as the causative agent of a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens, known as infectious bronchitis. Although IBV principally infects the upper respiratory tract, some IBV strains affect the renal tubuli, oviduct and parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Infection with IBV may lead to reduced growth and egg production, and is as such regarded as one of the economically most relevant viral pathogens in the poultry industry worldwide."
10688,Evolution of infectious bronchitis virus in Taiwan: Characterisation of RNA recombination in the nucleocapsid gene,"In addition to point mutation, RNA recombination is also involved in the generation of new antigenic variants. RNA recombination in a coronavirus was first demonstrated experimentally in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Lai et al., 1985; Makino et al., 1986) , and a high frequency of recombination was found both in vitro and in vivo after MHV infection (Keck et al., 1988; Makino et al., 1986) . Recombination sites were detected throughout nearly the entire genome, and many recombinants with multiple crossover sites were found (Liao and Lai, 1992) . The high frequency of RNA recombination in coronaviruses is likely caused by the unique mechanism of RNA synthesis, which involves discontinuous transcription and polymerase jumping (Cavanagh, 2007; Lai et al., 1985; Liao and Lai, 1992; Makino et al., 1986) . Putative IBV genetic recombination in the S gene has been documented in different field isolates, including a Japanese strain (KB8523), European Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family and causes significant economic loss in Taiwan (TW), even in flocks that have been extensively immunised with Massachusetts (Mass)-serotype vaccines. Phylogenetic analysis of all non-structural and most structural genes shows that TW IBV is genetically distinct from the US strain and more similar to Chinese (CH) IBV. In contrast, the nucleocapsid (N) gene of TW IBV presents phylogenetic incongruence. RNA recombination at the 5 0 end of the N gene between TW and US IBV is shown to be responsible for this discordance. Surprisingly, the recombinant N gene is found in all of tested TW IBV isolates, suggesting that a recombination event gave origin to a founder lineage. Our data indicate that RNA recombination in the recombinant 5 0 end of the N gene may have caused the emergence of the current IBV population in Taiwan."
10734,Case–control study of microbiological etiology associated with calf diarrhea,"Calf diarrhea is a major cause of economic loss with high morbidity and mortality in the cattle industry worldwide (Bartels et al., 2010; de la Fuente et al., 1999; Kelling et al., 2002; Uhde et al., 2008; United, 2007) . Many factors are known to contribute to calf diarrhea. Historically, calf diarrhea has been commonly attributed to bovine rotavirus group A (BRV-A), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), Salmonella spp. (Salmonella), Escherichia coli (E. coli) K99 + , and Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) type C and Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) (Acha et al., 2004; Reynolds et al., 1986; Saif and Smith, 1985; Snodgrass et al., 1986) . The specific etiology of many field cases of calf diarrhea still remain undiagnosed (Milnes et al., 2007) . Recently, bovine norovirus (BNoV), Nebovirus, bovine enterovirus (BEV) and Veterinary Microbiology 166 (2013) [375] [376] [377] [378] [379] [380] [381] [382] [383] [384] [385] Calf diarrhea is a major economic burden for the US cattle industry. A variety of infectious agents are implicated in calf diarrhea and co-infection of multiple pathogens is not uncommon in diarrheic calves. A case-control study was conducted to assess infectious etiologies associated with calf diarrhea in Midwest cattle farms. A total of 199 and 245 fecal samples were obtained from diarrheic and healthy calves, respectively, from 165 cattle farms. Samples were tested by a panel of multiplex PCR assays for 11 enteric pathogens: bovine rotavirus group A (BRV-A), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine enterovirus (BEV), bovine norovirus (BNoV), Nebovirus, bovine torovirus (BToV) Salmonella spp. (Salmonella), Escherichia coli (E. coli) K99 + , Clostridium perfringens with b toxin gene and Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum). The association between diarrhea and detection of each pathogen was analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. More than a half of the fecal samples from the diarrheic calves had multiple pathogens. Statistically, BRV-A, BCoV, BNoV, Nebovirus, Salmonella, E. coli K99 + , and C. parvum were significantly associated with calf diarrhea (p < 0.05). Among them, C. parvum and BRV-A were considered to be the most common enteric pathogens for calf diarrhea with high detection frequency (33.7% and 27.1%) and strong odds ratio (173 and 79.9). Unexpectedly BNoV (OR = 2.0) and Nebovirus (OR = 16.7) were identified with high frequency in diarrheic calves, suggesting these viruses may have a significant contribution to calf diarrhea."
10805,"Genetic, antigenic, and pathogenic characteristics of avian infectious bronchitis viruses genotypically related to 793/B in China","IB was first described as a respiratory disease of chicks by Schalk and Hawn in the USA in 1931 (Schalk and Hawn, 1931) . In 1956, Jungherr was the first to demonstrate that IBV was heterogeneous by isolating an IBV in Connecticut, USA, that did not cross-protect chickens against challenge with the original Massachusetts (Mass) isolate (Jungherr et al., 1956) ; since then, dozens of IBV serotypes and variants have been isolated worldwide (de Wit et al., 2011) . 793/B (also named 4/91 or CR88) is among the most well characterized and important IBV serotypes that emerged in the UK and France in the 1990s, and it has been associated with major illnesses and economic impacts in apparently well-vaccinated flocks (Gough et al., 1992; Parsons et al., 1992) . The pathology caused by 793/B is not typical of other IBV infections, as it was originally associated with mortality in breeders, scouring in broilers, and possibly muscle myopathy under field conditions. It is interesting that unlike some of the IBV serotypes that remain localized, 793/B type viruses quickly spread to many parts of the world (Xu et al., 2007) , but we do not know why this occurred. In addition, the 793/B type virus continues to be a problem in many parts of the world, but its structure and antigenicity do not appear to have changed greatly (de Wit et al., 2011) ."
11643,miR-146a-5p promotes replication of infectious bronchitis virus by targeting IRAK2 and TNFRSF18,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an enveloped, positivestrand RNA virus of Gamma coronavirus which infects chickens. It causes avian infectious bronchitis (IB), which is an acute highly contagious disease with severe economic losses in poultry industry worldwide [1] . IBV has a large number of genotypes and in China, 19 strains are isolated during 2011-2012. Infected chickens develop respiratory symptoms, coughing, sneezing, depression, nasal discharge, kidney, gonads, reduced egg production, poor egg quality and death. In recent year, nephropathogenic IBVs have become prevalent genotypes in China [2] , new nephropathogenic isolates induce more severe lesions to kidney and show high mortality in young chickens [3] . Currently only IBV Beaudette strain can replicate in HD11 [4] or Vero [5] cell lines. Several recent works have proved the induction of apoptosis and suppression of immune response are related to the pathogenicity of nephropathogenic IBVs [6, 7] . However, the key factor for these process during infection are still unclear."
11651,Immunohistochemical and molecular detection of natural cases of bovine rotavirus and coronavirus infection causing enteritis in dairy calves,"Livestock sector in India plays a pivotal role in supporting the livelihood of rural masses. This sector alone contributes 4.11% of the total GDP. Economics of any livestock farm dependent on the health of its neonates, which are the future herd [1] . Despite the fact, neonatal calves are abysmally cared, with the result significant morbidity and mortality of these calves incurred huge economic consequences. Amongst various causes, the calf diarrhoea (enteritis) is a commonly reported disease worldwide in cattle. Diarrhoea is a multi-factorial disease, which accounts for 57% of mortality in < 1 month old calves [2] . In diarrhoeic calves, although co-infection observed frequently, but at times a single etiology can also be the cause in some cases. Major enteric viral pathogens responsible for calf diarrhoea are mainly Rotavirus and Coronavirus. Of late, newer emerging enteric pathogens such as Torovirus, Norovirus, Nebovirus, Enterovirus, Calcivirus and Parvovirus have also been added to the list of diarrhoea causing agents [3] . Co-infection with more than one pathogen is more frequent and often worsens the symptoms. The tetrad of Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Cryptosporidium, and Escherichia coli accounts for 75-95% of infection in neonatal calves worldwide, of which especially rotavirus and coronavirus account for 27-36% and 20-26% infections, respectively [4] [5] [6] [7] . Among all pathogens, rotaviruses are the leading cause of calf diarrhoea, and coronaviruses are a major contributor to it [4, 5, 8, 9] . The coronavirus infect both small intestine and large intestine to cause severe disease [10] . In calves, group A rotavirus and coronavirus, either single or in combination, are predominately associated with neonatal (mostly up to 5-15 day old) diarrhoea [11] [12] . The diagnosis of diarrhoea (enteritis) cases is cumbersome due to non specific nature of clinical signs/lesions, interaction of polymicrobial agents and involvement of intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors [13] ."
11653,Gga-miR-30d regulates infectious bronchitis virus infection by targeting USP47 in HD11 cells,"Infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), is a highly contagious viral disease of the chicken [1] . Since IB was first described by Schalk and Hawn in USA in 1931 [2] , it has developed into one of the foremost causes of economic loss in the poultry industry, affecting the performance of both meat-type and egglaying chickens. IBV is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, classified taxonomically as a member of genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae [3] . Initially, this pathogen replicated primarily in the respiratory tract, causing a highly contagious respiratory disease characterized by nasal discharge, snicking, rales, and tracheal ciliostasis in chickens, but later reports demonstrated that it also replicated in many other epithelial surfaces, including enteric surfaces, oviducts, and kidneys [4] . Although vaccination is the most reliable approach to control IBV, the high mutation rate and recombination events differentiate IBV into numerous genotypes and serotypes, causing poor cross-protection of vaccines [5] . Therefore, it is urgent to apply new technologies and methods to control IBV."
11792,Dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO)-based real-time RT-PCR assay for accurate differentiation of four major viruses causing porcine viral diarrhea,"Currently, porcine viral diarrhea is a major cause of high morbidity and high mortality in piglets and an important threat to the development of pig industry worldwide, resulting in significant economic losses [1] . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) are the most common viral agents causing piglet diarrhea [2] . Moreover, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), since first reported in 2009, has become an important cause of newborn piglet diarrhea [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Sometimes, mixed infections in clinics are frequent. TGEV is a common cause of epidemic and endemic viral enteritis in neonates and senile pigs [10, 11] . Like TGEV, PEDV can cause severe enteritis in newborn piglets, but has higher mortality rate that may reach 100% during epidemics [12, 13] . PDCoV, as a newly emerging porcine intestinal coronavirus, can also cause enteritis and severe diarrhea in piglets [9] , leading to numerous economic losses for farmers in China. Its infection appears to be clinically milder with lower neonatal mortality rate of 30-40% compared to typical PEDV infection. PoRV is also a common cause of viral diarrhea diseases among newborn piglets [14, 15] . Infection with any of these viruses develops into similar clinical symptoms, including severe diarrhea and dehydration, and in some cases, mixed infections of these pathogens are common; therefore, it is difficult to distinguish them clinically [4, [16] [17] [18] Although virus isolation, immunofluorescence assay, and enzymelinked immunosorbent assays are standard diagnostic methods for viruses [19] , these techniques are time-consuming, relatively low in specificity and sensitivity, and therefore are not suitable for early diagnosis or epidemiological investigation of enterovirus-associated diseases. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods have been proven convenient and highly sensitive for detecting porcine diarrhea-associated viruses [20, 21] . Of them real-time SYBR Green PCR method that combines conventional PCR and fluorescent signal detection with advantages of high sensitivity, good repeatability, and intuitive results is widely used for epidemiological investigation and pathogen identification [22] [23] [24] . Moreover, the closed-tube detection of SYBR Green-based real-time PCR assay can effectively prevent aerosol pollution and reduce the incidence of false positives. However, the specificity of SYBR Green fluorescent dye is not so good that the melting curve of PCR product has to be used to confirm the amplification specificity. Therefore, primer design is the key to determining the detection specificity of SYBR Green-based real-time PCR method. However, the fundamental solution for eliminating false positive amplification still remains a challenge, which requires repeated optimization of primer parameters to achieve a high specificity, including primer specificity, primer length, melting temperature, GC content, less secondary structure, and PCR annealing temperature, in particular the development of a multiplex PCR assay."
11792,Dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO)-based real-time RT-PCR assay for accurate differentiation of four major viruses causing porcine viral diarrhea,"Porcine viral diarrhea disease still seriously endangers the development of the pig industry, and leads to significant economic losses for pig farmers worldwide. Clinically, PEDV, TGEV, PoRV, and PDCoV are the major causative agents of viral diarrhea in piglets. In some cases, mixed infections with two or more these viruses are common, which seriously interfere with clinical diagnosis [8, 16, 18, 33, 34] . Moreover, with the increasing growth of international trades and animal transports, the risk of transboundary spread of porcine viral diarrhea disease has also increased significantly. Therefore, to differentiate accurately infections of TGEV, PEDV, PoRV, and PDCoV in clinical specimens, and to prevent transboundary spread of porcine viral diarrhea disease, it is necessary to develop a rapid, accurate, and multi-target diagnostic method for the differentiation of TGEV, PEDV, PoRV, and PDCoV."

12072,SARS-CoV-2: fear versus data,"In comparison, the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in European or American developed countries of a comparable economic level is 1.3% (Table 3 ). If the extrapolation of deaths in AP-HM hospitals is correct, in metropolitan France, this would represent 543/0.8 * 100 = 67 875 cases of patients hospitalized with a respiratory infection with common coronaviruses in 2 months, which is almost as many cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. In fact, mortality from respiratory infections is extremely dependent on the quality of care and access to care, and severe forms have a better prognosis in countries with superior medical infrastructures. Under these conditions, there does not seem to be a significant difference between the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in OECD countries and that of common coronaviruses (χ 2 test, P=0.11). Of course, the major flaw in this study is that the percentage of deaths attributable to the virus is not determined, but this is the case for all studies reporting respiratory virus infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, viral infections are ecosystem infections where the outcome depends on the inoculums and the surrounding microbiota [26] . Thus, certain bacteria seem to be associated with symptomatic manifestations, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, which are known to cause an excess of mortality due to secondary infection. Finally, seasonality, geographic location, heat and humidity are co-factors, as are age, gender and underlying pathologies. Under these conditions, and all other things being equal, SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be described as being statistically more severe than infection with other coronaviruses in common circulation."

Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. With its high economic burden, it is considered a disease of major public health importance by the World Health Organization. The link between respiratory tract infections and acute exacerbation has been recognized for a long time. The aim of this retrospective study in routine care was to evaluate our practices concerning microbiological prescriptions in children hospitalized for asthma exacerbation. Study design. All children aged from 2 to 15 years hospitalized for asthma exacerbation between January 2010 and December 2011 in our unit were included in the study. Microbiological prescriptions, their indications, their results, and their cost were studied. Results. One hundred ninety-seven children were included in the study. A potential causative agent was sought in 79.7% of the children (n = 157) by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The main indications were upper airway infections, hypoxemia, and pneumonia. Viruses were detected in 23.8% of them (30/126). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected by PCR in only 3.2% of these patients (4/125) . No other bacterial agent was identified. There was no correlation between the severity of asthma exacerbation and the microbiological diagnosis of infection."
12966,Large-scale machine learning of media outlets for understanding public reactions to nation-wide viral infection outbreaks,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an infectious disease caused by the MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [1, 2] . A large outbreak of MERS occurred in Korea from May to July 2015 [3, 4] . Although the country had advanced medical systems with reliable public health monitoring capabilities, the outbreak, which started with a single case, caused massive public fear, affecting various aspects of civil life. Inappropriate initial responses and insufficient information were believed to cause unnecessary social chaos [5] [6] [7] . Because of worries about infection, the majority of the public refrained from performing normal social and economic activities [8] [9] [10] . For example, owing to a sharp decrease in Chinese tourists, the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) reported that the number of tourists in June decreased by 41% compared with the previous year [11] . As a result, the country had to experience lower economic growth than originally estimated before the outbreak, even though the Korean government declared a de facto end to the MERS outbreak on July 28, 2015, approximately 10 weeks after the first confirmed case [12] ."
12966,Large-scale machine learning of media outlets for understanding public reactions to nation-wide viral infection outbreaks,"An overreaction to a moderate infectious disease by the public can cause various unnecessary complications. By contrast, negligence with regard to dangerous infections can result in a widespread pandemic that could have been controlled by sufficient public attention. For instance, although the incidence and mortality rate of tuberculosis in Korea are the highest among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, public attention has not been drawn to this airborne disease as vividly as MERS."
12966,Large-scale machine learning of media outlets for understanding public reactions to nation-wide viral infection outbreaks,"Before this study, it was already conjectured that Korean people showed unnecessarily high levels of fear and worries about MERS, which then put the nation in danger of short-term economic recession caused by reduced social and economic activities. By mining MERS-related social media, we could verify this conjecture rapidly and effectively, reporting analysis results only a few days after the de facto end of the MERS outbreak declared by the government. Relying on traditional approaches would require substantially more time and resources."
13292,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection: Etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis and immunoprophylaxis","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genera Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in significant economic losses. The disease was initially reported in European and Asian pig industries over the last 30 years, with the virus first appearing in England (Wood, 1977) and Belgium (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) in the early 1970s. Recently, PEDV has also been reported in the US (Stevenson et al., 2013) . Since then, the virus has rapidly spread nationwide throughout the USA (Cima, 2013) and to other countries in North America, including Canada and Mexico. As a result of the significant impact of PEDV, the US pig industry has lost almost 10% of its domestic pig population after only a 1 year-epidemic period, amounting to approximately 7 million piglets."
13292,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection: Etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis and immunoprophylaxis","Similar epidemiological and clinical features between PEDV and another Alphacoronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), have led to complications in diagnosis, requiring differential laboratory tests (Saif et al., 2012) . Since the emergence of a natural spike gene deletion mutant of TGEV, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) in 1984, the spread of TGEV has been reduced in PRCV-seropositive herds due to cross-protective immunity with TGEV (Saif et al., 2012) . In contrast, PEDV continues to spread and cause economic problems worldwide."
13292,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection: Etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis and immunoprophylaxis","Disappearance and re-emergence of epidemic PED indicates that PEDV is effectively able to escape from the current vaccination protocols, biosecurity and control systems. Endemic PED is a significant problem, which is exacerbated by the emergence or potential importation of multiple PEDV variants into countries. Epidemic PEDV strains spread rapidly and cause a high number of pig deaths and substantial economic losses. These strains are highly enteropathogenic and acutely infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection. PEDV infections cause acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by viremia (viral RNA) that leads to severe diarrhea and vomiting, followed by extensive dehydration and imbalanced blood electrolytes as the major cause of death in nursing piglets. A better understanding of the pathogenic characteristics of epidemic or endemic PEDV strains is needed to prevent and control the disease in affected regions and in the development of effective vaccine."
14555,Seasonality of infectious diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome–what we don't know can hurt us,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus caused severe disease and heavy economic losses before apparently coming under complete control. Our understanding of the forces driving seasonal disappearance and recurrence of infectious diseases remains fragmentary, thus limiting any predictions about whether, or when, SARS will recur. It is true that most established respiratory pathogens of human beings recur in wintertime, but a new appreciation for the high burden of disease in tropical areas reinforces questions about explanations resting solely on cold air or low humidity. Seasonal variation in host physiology may also contribute. Newly emergent zoonotic diseases such as ebola or pandemic strains of influenza have recurred in unpredictable patterns. Most established coronaviruses exhibit winter seasonality, with a unique ability to establish persistent infections in a minority of infected animals. Because SARS coronavirus RNA can be detected in the stool of some individuals for at least 9 weeks, recurrence of SARS from persistently shedding human or animal reservoirs is biologically plausible."
14555,Seasonality of infectious diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome–what we don't know can hurt us,"Uncertainties about the seasonal recurrence of SARS are more than academic questions about the mechanisms underlying basic patterns of epidemiology. With the estimated economic impact of the first few months of SARS ranging from US$10 billion to 100 billion, and the accumulation of more than 8000 human cases and more than 700 deaths, the consequences of our ignorance regarding the seasonality of infectious diseases are glaringly apparent. 43, 44 Major vaccine manufacturers lack persuasive information on predicted incidence to guide the enormous investments that would be required to rapidly develop a vaccine and make it available, and pharmaceutical companies, uncertain if a market for a new product will exist may delay developing antiviral drugs effective against coronaviruses."
15388,Immune response of mature cows subjected to annual booster vaccination against neonatal calf diarrhoea with two different commercial vaccines: A non-inferiority study,"Neonatal calf diarrhoea (NCD) affects mainly calves under 4 weeks of age. It is characterised by a diarrhoea leading to dehydration and acidosis which can have systemic consequences and potentially lead to death (Millemann, 2009) . The prevalence of NCD has been estimated around 20% and this disease is a major cause of death in young calves, responsible for more than 50% in some countries (Millemann, 2009; Bartels et al., 2010; Lorenz et al., 2011; Cho and Yoon, 2014; Meganck et al., 2015) . The loss of calves, the management of the disease and the consequences on the health, growth rate and reproductive potential of surviving calves can lead to a significant economic loss (Millemann, 2009; Cho and Yoon, 2014) . The environment, herd size and farm management practices, such as hygiene, feeding, routine use of antibiotics, neonatal care and colostrum management, can influence NCD prevalence in herds (Bendali et al., 1999; Bartels et al., 2010; Meganck et al., 2014) . These factors should be evaluated and properly monitored to avoid NCD. The etiological diagnosis of calf diarrhoea can also be sought in order to limit the consequences with the appropriate etiologic or preventive treatment (Millemann, 2009; Meganck et al., 2014 Meganck et al., , 2015 ."
15601,Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides to protect against Neonatal Diarrheal Disease: An alternative to antibiotics,"Neonatal Diarrheal Disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in dairy and beef calves and improved prevention and treatment methods would be of significant economic benefit to the cattle industry. The use of antibiotics as a treatment for bacterial infections and as a prophylactic additive in feed has dramatically improved cattle production in the last century, however, the rise of antibioticresistant bacteria and pressure to reduce or eliminate use of antibiotics has collectively driven livestock industries to seek appropriate alternatives."
15695,Drivers of airborne human-to-human pathogen transmission,"The horror of airborne infectious diseases subsided substantially in the 20th century in developed nations, largely due to implementation of hygiene practices and the development of countermeasures such as vaccination and antimicrobials. The recent emergence of zoonotic pathogens such as avian influenza A viruses (e.g. H5N1 and H7N9) and coronaviruses (CoV) (i.e. SARS CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome)) raises the specter of future pandemics with unprecedented health and economic impacts if these pathogens gain the ability to spread efficiently between humans via the airborne route. While cross-species barriers have helped avoid a human pandemic with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) viruses, a limited number of mutations in circulating avian H5N1 viruses would be needed for the acquisition of airborne transmissibility in mammals [1 ] . A global pandemic by SARS CoV was averted largely by fast identification, rapid surveillance and effective quarantine practices. However, not all emerging pathogens can be contained due to a delay in initial detection, an inability to properly assess pandemic risk, or an inability to contain an outbreak at the point of origin. Before 2009, widely circulating H1N1 swine viruses were largely thought to pose little pandemic risk but, despite early attempts to limit spread, pH1N1 caused the first influenza virus pandemic of the 21st century. Implementation of suitable countermeasures is hampered by our limited capability to anticipate the sequence of events following the initial detection of a novel microorganism in an animal or human host. In the immediate future, the occurrence of (i.e. frequency of spill-over events from an animal to the human population), the detection of (i.e. diagnostic capabilities), and the awareness for (i.e. likelihood of public health services to recognize) novel epidemic agents will likely increase qualitatively and quantitatively. Updating of emergency preparedness plans in an evidence-guided process requires an interdisciplinary concept of research and public health efforts taking into account the multifactorial nature of the problem to aid policy formulation [2] . Here we build on a conceptual framework for the classification of drivers of human exposure to animal pathogens [3 ] and suggest a framework of drivers determining the efficiency of human-to-human transmission involving the airspace."
15695,Drivers of airborne human-to-human pathogen transmission,"To predict the likelihood that a certain pathogen identified in, or next to, a human being (index patient) will become a pandemic threat, a multilevel framework of drivers has to be considered. Categorized in a descriptive manner, drivers may act at the level of cells and tissues, of individuals, communities and countries, or even on a global scale. However, drivers are highly interactive and may be effective at different scales or levels. As an example, host susceptibility might be directly encoded for in the host genome (e.g. by the presence or absence, by the expression or silencing of genes encoding for pathogen receptors). Once the transmitted pathogen finds an entry into such a susceptible human host, its interaction with the host immune system ultimately determines whether infection is established and whether it progresses to a point where onward transmission to a new host is facilitated. These interactions are influenced at the individual or host level by other drivers governing an immune response. These drivers in turn may include the host genetic background as genetic entities impact on the kind of immune response (e.g. Th1 versus Th2 bias) developed by an individual or a group of individuals within a population. Pre-existing immunity or the presence of concurrent infections or disruption to the normal functioning of the immune system including co-morbidities which may represent more distal drivers or in turn modulate more distal drivers, play important roles. With effective treatment, the contagiousness of a particular disease may be reduced not only by decreasing the number of the pathogens in the infected site and those that will be expectorated but also by introducing, for example, antibiotic into the infectious droplet nuclei [49] . Many drivers are acting at the tissue or individual level but are themselves subject to modification at the community level by, for example, the frequency and intensity of social contact and the composition of the group a person is interacting with, for example, in terms of health and hygiene standard and age distribution. Examples are tuberculosis in the working class in the age of industrialization and the Spanish flu during World War I. More distal factors are relevant at the country level including (the variability of) host population genetics (susceptibility of the population as a whole), demography, public health strategies for treatment or vaccination or access to medical care, which are likewise, to some extent, governed by socio-economic drivers. Air pollution, land use, urbanization and socio-economic changes are important drivers of emergence of airborne infections at the supranational level. Although human population densities have continued to rise and reach unprecedented levels, airborne diseases of public concern in developed countries in the second half of the 20th century have typically comprised relatively self-limiting or preventable diseases like the common cold, seasonal flu and MeV. Continuous developments like agglomeration of settlement areas in developing countries, along with urbanization and rural depopulation, and exponentially increasing human movement in numbers and distances on a global scale, however, may outpace contemporary achievements in disease prevention. Climatic changes also occur at a global level, which could have serious impact on infectious diseases in humans and animals [50] . Extreme weather conditions alter seasonal patterns of emergence and expansion of diseases even though direct proof for the influence of climate change on regional, national, supranational or global level on the emergence of new or frequency of established infections is difficult to obtain. To mirror the complexity of the problem we suggest a concise and weighted framework of drivers ( Figure 2 ) taking into consideration different levels, from cell and tissue through to global scale but also the multitude of influences between these levels. While some drivers at an outer level may only imprint on one driver in the level below, other drivers can impact several lower level drivers and in sum may be equally important to drivers considered to act from an outer level. Classification of drivers as acting at a more proximal or more distal level also is not exclusive and inverted imprinting may occur under several circumstances as outlined above. Framework for the classification of drivers of human-to-human transmission of zoonotic pathogens by the airborne route (interhuman barrier). These drivers operate on tissue, individual, community, country, and global levels. The presented framework also makes provisions for the multitude of influences between levels highlighting that some drivers have implications for several lower level drivers and in sum may be equally important to drivers considered to act from an outer level."
15695,Drivers of airborne human-to-human pathogen transmission,"Beyond representing an ever-increasing ethical and economic burden, the recent more frequent occurrence of zoonotic pathogens in the human population also inheres in the unique opportunity to further our knowledge of the prerequisites for airborne pandemic spread. Genomicsbased methods have already allowed a significant advance in our understanding of the evolution and spread of bacterial pathogens. In the developed world, whole genome sequencing is being established for routine use in clinical microbiology, both for tracking transmission and spread of pathogens, as well as prediction of drugresistance profiles, allowing rapid outbreak detection and analysis in almost real-time, as evolution occurs in the wild [54 ] . Except for influenza A viruses, genetic correlates (surrogates) of the ability of a zoonotic pathogen to efficiently overcome the interspecies barrier and allow rapid spread within the human population are poorly defined. Any emergence of novel molecular patterns in microorganisms results from an evolutionary process driven by factors not encoded for in genomes and determined by the frequencies of genome alterations occurring under natural conditions. The broad introduction of 'omic's' technologies, advances in global data exchange capabilities and the advent of (bio)informatic tools allowing processing of large data collections ('big data') have put the technical capacity to integrate phenotypic data from clinical, from epidemiological and from experimental studies in vitro and in vivo at our disposal, with relevant target species like livestock in particular, and allow genome-wide association studies. Deploying the categorization of drivers and the relative level of their impact as suggested herein will allow for a weighting of the different drivers in the specific framework for any particular pathogen, and help to predict the pandemic potential of airborne pathogens."
16345,Cynomolgus Macaque as an Animal Model for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003 affected global health and caused major economic disruption. Adequate animal models are required to study the underlying pathogenesis of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection and to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics. We report the first findings of measurable clinical disease in nonhuman primates (NHPs) infected with SARS-CoV.
16345,Cynomolgus Macaque as an Animal Model for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,"In late 2002, Chinese health officials reported an unusual number of atypical pneumonia cases in Guangdong Province, and within 2 months, the World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted of an outbreak widespread throughout the province [1] . By March 2003, the illness designated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had spread to Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and Toronto, Canada [2] . The global SARS outbreak ended that July, but during its existence the disease caused 774 fatalities and had a significant economic impact on Southeast Asia [3] [4] [5] . A special concern was its predilection for nosocomial spread, as 21% of SARS cases occurred in healthcare workers . In certain local outbreaks, hospital staff accounted for over 50% of cases, and nosocomial spread to other patients or family members accounted for a significant proportion of SARS cases [6] ."
17556,Proteomic analysis of purified coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus particles,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the coronavirus of domestic chickens that causes acute, highly contagious respiratory disease, is one of the most important causes of economic loss in the poultry industry. IBV is an enveloped virus with continuous, positive and single-stranded RNA genome, which is the largest of any RNA virus characterized [1] and encodes four types of structural proteins. The spike (S) glycoprotein, together with small envelope (E) protein and matrix (M) glycoprotein, consists of the viral envelope, whereas the nucleocapsid (N) protein interacts with genomic RNA of the virus to form the viral nucleocapsid, in the invariable order 5'-S-E-M-N-3'. Proteins S, E, and M have been studied for their important roles in receptor binding and virus budding. S mediates attachment to cellular receptors and entry by fusion with cell membranes, whereas M interacting with S and N proteins is an essential component of virion and plays pivotal roles in virion assembly, budding and maturation [2, 3] . In addition, S protein can inhibit host cell translation by interacting with eIF3f [4] and the interaction between M and actin facilitates virion assembly and budding [5] . E is a poorly characterized small envelope protein present in low levels in the virions. The significance of the E protein appears to be critical for viral budding. Another role for protein E is that it can promote apoptosis [6, 7] ."
17637,Effects of Coronavirus Infections in Children,"The isolation of the coronavirus (CoV) identifi ed as the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome and the detection of 2 new human CoVs (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) have led to studies of the epidemiology and clinical and socioeconomic effects of infections caused by all HCoVs, including those known since the late 1960s (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43). HCoV infections can be associated with respiratory and extrarespiratory manifestations, including central nervous system involvement. Furthermore, unlike other RNA viruses, HCoVs can easily mutate and recombine when different strains infect the same cells and give rise to a novel virus with unpredictable host ranges and pathogenicity. Thus, circulating HCoVs should be closely monitored to detect the spread of particularly virulent strains in the community at an early stage and to facilitate the development of adequate preventive and therapeutic measures."
17637,Effects of Coronavirus Infections in Children,"The identifi cation of SARS-CoV and the isolation of 2 novel HCoVs in humans (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) (5,6) have led to several studies of the epidemiology and clinical and socioeconomic effects of HCoV infections, which were greatly facilitated by the availability of modern molecular biology methods that enable direct viral identifi cation in respiratory secretions (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . Interest was strengthened by the demonstration that SARS could be considered a zoonotic infection because, after it was described and the causative agent identifi ed from patients in the People's Republic of China, SARS-CoV-like viruses were isolated from caged animals, including palm civets and raccoon dogs in wildlife markets of the same Chinese province (27) . This fi nding and the subsequent independent discovery of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats indicated that wild animals could be the reservoir of these viruses and that, in a suitable environment, they could infect humans and cause epidemics. New data concerning old and the new HCoVs raise the question of whether HCoVs may be more clinically important in children than was previously thought, thus indicating the need for a systematic evaluation of their circulation and the availability of preventive and therapeutic measures."
17637,Effects of Coronavirus Infections in Children,"The clinical role of all non-SARS CoVs seems to be similar: in most healthy children: they cause URTIs that spontaneously disappear in a few days. This fi nding is clearly shown by our data indicating no difference in the incidence and clinical severity of the diseases associated with HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63. Regardless of the HCoV causing the infection, >50% of the children had a common cold or pharyngitis, and laboratory and radiologic investigations were required in <15% (18) . Moreover, we also found that the socioeconomic effects of these viruses on the families of the infected children was marginal: the viruses spread signifi cantly less than infl uenza viruses among household members, caused only a limited number of similar infections in the family, and led to fewer lost working or school days (18) ."
17637,Effects of Coronavirus Infections in Children,"Superfi cial analysis of all of the available data concerning the effects of HCoVs in children suggests that the assessment of the importance of HCoVs made before SARS-CoV was identifi ed can still be considered valid. In general, all of these viruses (including SARS-CoV) have been confi rmed as mainly respiratory viruses with limited clinical relevance in children. They cause mainly URTIs, are not frequently isolated in hospitalized children (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) , and, because they are rarely transmitted to other household members, have a marginal socioeconomic effects on families (18) . Even SARS-CoV infection, which had a dramatic effect on adults, was mainly associated with relatively mild disease in almost all patients <12 years of age (28, 34) . Moreover, most children with a diagnosis of severe respiratory syndrome in whom a HCoV was isolated were coinfected by other respiratory viruses (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . These fi nding suggest that the severity of the respiratory disease at least in some of these cases was attributable to the second virus."
17651,Prevalence and Phylogeny of Coronaviruses in Wild Birds from the Bering Strait Area (Beringia),"Wild bird species are reservoirs for a number of emerging viruses. The most well-known among them is avian influenza A virus [19] . Wild bird species may also harbour other respiratory and enteric viruses, including CoVs. IBV is a gamma-coronavirus that is responsible for severe economic losses in the poultry industry [20] . This global virus causes an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens (Gallus gallus) of all ages and diminishes egg production in hens [21] . A number of IBV strains cause severe nephritis, with mortality reaching up to 30% [20] . Disease control is based mostly on vaccination, but the virus constant antigenic changes sometimes result in incomplete protection [22] . Although chickens are the primary natural host of IBV, several research groups have recently found IBV-like viruses and new CoVs in other bird species [13, 23] . Furthermore, new CoVs that are genetically distinct from IBV have been identified in different bird families [9] and in beluga whales [10] . Our investigations showed the presence of gamma-CoVs in wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), indicating that wild ducks may spread and harbour CoVs [24] . These data emphasize that the geographic distribution, host range and genetic diversity of avian CoVs are much greater than was previously thought, a finding that could impact both animal and human health."
17828,Proteomic analysis of chicken embryonic trachea and kidney tissues after infection in ovo by avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus,"Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the most serious diseases of chickens. It is of economic importance in the poultry industry worldwide and is associated with respiratory disease, reduction in weight gain, poor egg production and quality, and decreased feed conversion efficiency. Its etiologic agent is the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), which is a Gamma coronavirus of the coronavirus genus and replicates primarily in the upper respiratory tract, kidney, and oviduct of chickens [1] [2] [3] ."
18945,Recent Progress in Studies of Arterivirus- and Coronavirus-Host Interactions,"As these viruses infect livestock, coronaviral and arteriviral infections in farms have resulted in large-scale economic losses in farming nations, and are therefore of exceptional veterinary research value. Coronaviruses in fowls, as exemplified by the highly contagious IBV in chickens, can be highly lethal to young chicks. IBV is the etiological agent of infectious bronchitis, an avian disease that is mainly associated with upper respiratory and urogenital tract infections in adult chickens, and to a lesser extent, nephrogenic infections, or inflammation of the kidneys [6, 7] . The impact of IBV infection is also emphatically increased as a consequence of its enhancement of diseases associated with lethal co-infections by bacteria and mycoplasmas [8, 9] . Domestic animals such as cats and dogs are also susceptible to coronaviruses. Feline coronaviruses, especially feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)-a mutation of Feline Enteric Coronavirus (FECV), may induce lethal diseases in cats [10] , while canine coronavirus (CCoV) infections, which cause canine enteric illness in dogs, are prevalent as well [11] . In larger livestock like pigs and cattle, on the other hand, coronaviruses and arteriviruses typically establish enteric infections. An infection or outbreak can cause severe economic losses from the death of young offspring, lifelong impact on the yield of animal produce such as eggs and milk, weight losses and the general health of the population. Bovine coronavirus (BCV), for example, causes Winter Dysentery (WD) in adult cows and diarrhea in young calves [12] ."
19014,A framework for the study of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers: spillover of bat pathogens as a case study,"There is a growing awareness of the increasing threats presented to humans by emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) [1 -3] , with the majority of human EIDs being zoonotic-originating especially from wildlife reservoirs [4] . Emerging diseases have a huge impact on human societies across the world, affecting both current and future generations. Changes in human living patterns, along with environmental and climate changes, pose unprecedented challenges to the global health of people, animals and ecosystems. Ecosystem health correlates with human health [5] , but the precise relationships remain poorly understood [6] . Understanding and responding to the ecological, social and economic conditions facilitating disease emergence and transmission represent one of the major challenges for humankind today [7] . The risk is not uniform [2] : 53 per cent of global EID outbreaks from 1996 to 2009 were in Africa, yet the continent lags behind severely in infectious disease detection and emerging epidemic warnings [8] ."
19014,A framework for the study of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers: spillover of bat pathogens as a case study,"In this multifaceted context, bats offer a critically important focus for study at the human -wildlife interface. Bats are an important reservoir and vector for spread of EIDs. Bats perform major ecological functions by pollinating plants and dispersing their seeds, as well as regulating insect populations that are critical for maintaining ecosystems; some have been recognized as 'keystone species' [10] . Yet bats are associated with zoonoses of potentially great global public health impact and are the source of lyssa viruses [11] , Hendra virus [12] , Nipah virus [13] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses [14, 15] , and Ebola and Marburg viruses [16 -19] ; all are RNA viruses that can cause currently untreatable diseases in people, often with high case fatality rates. Bats frequently live in very close proximity to humans, often in large numbers. They often interact closely with livestock and other domestic animals that are potential intermediate hosts for viruses that can infect humans, thus effectively expanding the wildlife-human interface. These interactions are shaped by environmental, social and politico-economic drivers at multiple scales, yet these processes and interrelationships are poorly characterized and understood. Bats epitomize growing challenges associated with human-wildlife-disease interactions, and thus offer a valuable model for building a new, holistic, policy-engaged paradigm to address these, now and in the future."
19014,A framework for the study of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers: spillover of bat pathogens as a case study,"RNA viruses associated with Old World fruit bats pose zoonotic disease threats of high public health significance internationally. We propose that pathogen spillover occurs from bats to humans and affects public health, but the dynamics, effects and extent to which spillover is recognized, and responded to, depend on varied combinations of biological, environmental, social and politico-economic processes and drivers."
19014,A framework for the study of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers: spillover of bat pathogens as a case study,"Zoonosis-related health issues also highlight deeply understudied social and environmental questions. The presence of fruit bats in cities in Africa, Asia and Australia, for instance, demonstrates their ability to adapt to changing environments, but also increases human -bat interactions, adding to those occurring through rural land use, livelihoods and occupations. But there is little understanding of the social, economic, political or environmental dynamics and drivers at different scales that shape these interactions, or of the beliefs, understandings and cultural practices which surround human -bat contact. How local people and national and international policy-makers perceive bats and associated disease risks, and how these different 'framings' might mould or impact public health policies, is very unclear. Framing refers to the ways in which scientific topics and policy processes are delineated. Cultural contingencies, life experiences, intellectual paradigms and political agendas are often highly influential in shaping how science or policy is conceptualized. These unrecognized 'blinkers' limit the possibilities to recognize multiple perspectives, seek more participatory solutions or question the assumptions on which decisions get made. As Jasanoff [41] points out, cognitive frames 'impose discipline on unruly events by creating understandable causal relationships, identifying agents of harmful behaviour, and finding solutions that convey a sense of security and moral order'. Leach & Scoones [42] thus argue for the necessity of recognizing other kinds of knowledge shaped, or 'framed', through 'other practical cultural assumptions, meanings and life-worlds'. Understanding how, why, where and for whom bat zoonoses pose problems, particularly in regions where public health surveillance is patchy or under-resourced, and how policies and interventions should address these, necessarily requires an integrated, interdisciplinary conceptual framework, informing specific questions to be investigated across a diversity of global settings."
19014,A framework for the study of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers: spillover of bat pathogens as a case study,"A new holistic paradigm integrating biological, social and environmental science approaches is required to explain the mechanisms and impacts of zoonotic emergence, particularly through intermediate hosts. Novel mathematical frameworks have highlighted how chance events in viral evolution and transmission can lead to successful spillover [26, 43] . Ecological models for zoonotic emergence are still very patchy [26, 27] and need further development. Together, mathematical ecology and epidemiology provide mechanistic frameworks to study the dynamics of infections in bat reservoir populations [44] . Social science perspectives, especially from anthropology, are needed to elucidate how people perceive and interact with bats. Environmental science and modelling are necessary for addressing the ecological drivers of change that may impact on bat populations and hence spillover risk. Public health, social science and science-policy perspectives are important to consider how these diseases may be diagnosed, or continue undetected in humans, how policies and responses are framed and the political-economic interests that might influence this. This combination of disciplines needs to be carefully integrated in a manner that has not really been achieved for the study of any disease, let alone a wildlife-associated zoonosis. Here, the central involvement of bat conservation organizations could also enable synergies between science and policy and provide clear pathways to impact."
19014,A framework for the study of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers: spillover of bat pathogens as a case study,"Work needs to be organized from the outset in a manner that both recognizes and respects individual disciplinary approaches, but that also cuts across them in a truly interdisciplinary manner in order to deliver genuine integration, both between disciplines and across localities. Although frequently ignored in the natural sciences, we propose a clear interdisciplinary conceptual framework (as is more common in interdisciplinary social science work, such as development studies) to capture the integration across all scales that is required (figure 1). Our framework integrates dynamic interactions between bats, viruses, intermediate livestock hosts and people in a local system, influenced by wider environmental, social and politico-economic drivers. Figure 1 is inspired by a range of research fields, drawing together perspectives from medical and veterinary (virology, epidemiology, public health), environmental (ecology, biodiversity) and social (anthropology, politics, science-policy studies) sciences. Each key element of the framework comprises a potential research theme within which specific questions can be investigated; importantly, novel insights and policy impacts should be derived from their integration."
19014,A framework for the study of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers: spillover of bat pathogens as a case study,"Spillover dynamics are subject to a range of local influences and practices, both social and environmental, including environmental influences 1 on viral pathogen dynamics, such as interactions with susceptible sympatric species. Land use, wildlife management and conservation practices can shape bat ecology and populations. The interactions between bats and ecosystems are manifold; through seed dispersal and pollination, bat populations also influence ecological structure and functioning. Infection dynamics are shaped by (and can, in turn, feed back to shape) bat ecology and related ecosystem processes; in turn, infection dynamics influence spillover dynamics. Human -bat interactions, including livelihood and ritual practices, bring different people into contact with bats and potentially expose them to disease. The public perception of bats and bat diseases can trigger eradication efforts that may then increase spillover risks. Public health impacts and detection, including disease surveillance and diagnostics for known pathogens (and capacity to detect previously unrecognized pathogens through newly evolving 'pathogen discovery' techniques [21, 22] ) and healthseeking practices, shape whether human infections with bat-derived pathogens are recognized. Such local system dynamics are shaped by wider drivers of change (environmental, social, political and economic), operating across different geographical scales. Importantly, our framework integrates a focus on political, cultural and policy framings, examining how different people in communities and in national and international agencies understand and represent spillover dynamics, public health threats and influences, and how these framings shape policy responses. Finally, we attend to how local system dynamics are shaped by wider drivers of change-environmental, economic, demographic, social-operating across local, regional, national and global scales. Taken together, bats provide a model for these framework elements, which should provide the evidence required to inform a series of 'one health' interventions and policy impacts, and assist the building of new interdisciplinary capabilities for research, policy engagement and disease mitigation while also enabling the conservation of biodiversity."
19014,A framework for the study of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers: spillover of bat pathogens as a case study,"In this challenging theme, the obvious epidemiological and public health approaches must be integrated with anthropological perspectives that emphasize how prevailing social and cultural values, legal, political and economic factors and organizational norms influence disease classifications and diagnoses [102, 103] . Critical medical anthropology [104] has directed the attention towards the social and political determinants of ill health, disease distribution and access to health care. Recent approaches in health systems research understand health care systems not merely as structures of services, goods and personnel, but as knowledge economies [105] involving health markets that include formal and informal practitioners, with a range of factors influencing people's understandings of illness and health-seeking behaviour. These concepts should underpin the investigation of the extent to which bat virus spillover events are recognized by a range of groups and how diagnosis and public health responses are shaped by institutional factors and health care workers' practices. From socio-epidemiological perspectives, an investigation of how behavioural and socio-demographic factors can predispose people and their domestic animals to spillover infections would be very valuable. Relevant biomedical syndromes must be considered alongside enquiry regarding the extent to which zoonotic disease risk is recognized by local people and features in their concepts of illnesses and perceptions of relevant causes of morbidity and mortality. The detailed laboratory investigation and confirmation of specific infections in humans must follow the same detailed criteria as used for defining the specific infections in bat hosts. Careful quantitative planning and consideration of control selection will be vital for the successful interpretation of data from human patients in epidemiological studies."
19014,A framework for the study of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers: spillover of bat pathogens as a case study,"(e) Drivers Drivers of spillover, as shown in figure 1, may include environmental and climate changes, as well as socioeconomic, demographic and political drivers of relevant processes, such as agricultural intensification, livestock keeping or bushmeat hunting [47, 106, 107] . Such drivers are rather poorly understood for most zoonotic systems, so even improved qualitative study would be valuable, asking:"
19014,A framework for the study of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers: spillover of bat pathogens as a case study,"Contextual descriptions of key drivers identified for each locality should be constructed by drawing on existing environmental, social and historical literatures, including qualitative analyses, to track up from key processes identified in the human-bat interactions and bats and ecology themes to identify national and international influences on these. Optimally, this would be complemented by empirical modelling techniques [2, 108] to investigate the correlation of disease spillover Spatially explicit ecosystem data, such as land use, wildlife densities, livestock densities, human population densities, climate and socio-economic variables are increasingly available for such analyses [2, 108] . With a careful interpretation, empirical models can quantify the impact of different spatial drivers on risk of initial spillover and subsequent spread and at what spatial scales these may be important. On the basis of time series analyses, risk maps could be generated that predict spatio-temporally changing 'hot zones' for spillover, thus contributing to forecasting."
19194,Bioinformatics and evolutionary insight on the spike glycoprotein gene of QX-like and Massachusetts strains of infectious bronchitis virus,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes avian infectious bronchitis, a highly contagious disease that affects poultry and produces severe economic losses worldwide. IBV belongs to the order of Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae and to genus of Gamma-coronavirus group 3 [1] . The genome is positive-sense single stranded RNA of about 27.6 kb and contains 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions [2] [3] [4] ."
19259,Epimedium koreanum Nakai Water Extract Exhibits Antiviral Activity against Porcine Epidermic Diarrhea Virus In Vitro and In Vivo,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, and high mortality in the piglets [1, 2] . PEDV is known for the family of Coronaviridae containing enveloped, singlestranded RNA [3] [4] [5] . Most of newborn piglets infected by PEDV would die and pigs of all ages are also affected and exhibit severe symptom like massive diarrhea and dehydration, resulting in serious damage in the swine industry [6] [7] [8] . Until now, there are no effective treatments or vaccines developed to prevent economic loss by PEDV."
19259,Epimedium koreanum Nakai Water Extract Exhibits Antiviral Activity against Porcine Epidermic Diarrhea Virus In Vitro and In Vivo,"It is inevitable to develop a novel, strong viral inhibitor to prevent economical loss from PED viral infection. Although some inhibitors were screened and tested for antiviral effect on PED virus, new effective antiviral remedy without toxicity should be developed. KIOM 198 exhibited antiviral activity on not only PED virus but other corona virus like sm98 and TGE virus. We examined whether antiviral agents available commercially, such as Deoxynojirimycin, Mizoribine, and Ribavirin, could inhibit PED viral growth. Each compound at concentration of 100 μg/mL was treated to the Vero cells infected with PED virus and compared their antiviral activity with KIOM 198. These agents except for KIOM 198 did not significantly inhibit PED viral growth in this study (data not shown). These results mean KIOM 198 contains specific, remarkable antiviral activity on PED virus, which is not inhibited by other well-known antiviral drug. Antiviral activity of KIOM 198 was confirmed in vivo disease model. Piglets infected with PED virus expressed disease symptoms like diarrhea, but piglet oral-administered with KIOM 198 had normal feces and no virus was detected in the early time and 10fold lower viruses were found in the feces later. This result suggests the antiviral effect of KIOM 198 on the virus is very effective in the early stage."
20437,Structural Basis for the Identification of the N-Terminal Domain of Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein as an Antiviral Target,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large group of RNA viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes that cause various upper and lower respiratory tract infections in both humans and animals. 1, 2 The human coronavirus strains OC43 and 229E (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E) were identified in the 1960s. 3 Between 2003 and 2004, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a worldwide epidemic and had a significant economic impact in the countries affected by the outbreak. 4 In 2004, another alphacoronavirus (HCoV-NL63) was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis. 5 In 2005, Woo et al. discovered the novel betacoronavirus HKU1 in patients with respiratory tract infections. 6 Recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was found in patients with severe acute respiratory tract infections in the Middle East. As is true for all coronavirus infections, there is no currently available efficacious therapy."
20462,Fluorescence in situ hybridization investigation of potentially pathogenic bacteria involved in neonatal porcine diarrhea,"Neonatal diarrhea is a major problem that leads to reduced weight gain, increased morbidity and mortality among piglets and has, in consequence, an economic impact on the swine industry. Diarrhea in suckling piglets is often of infectious nature and results from interactions between pathogens, an immature immune system and the environment. In the past, a number of microorganisms have been associated with pig neonatal enteritis i.e. rotavirus A, coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens type C, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Cystoisospora suis and Strongyloides ransomi [1, 2] . However, in recent years, the pig industry in many countries has experienced an increased number of neonatal diarrhea cases not caused by the above mentioned pathogens [3] [4] [5] . Considering contribution of bacterial agents, identification of the etiology of this diarrhea becomes challenging and problematic. The gastrointestinal tract hosts diverse population of microorganisms composed of commensals and potentially pathogenic bacteria. These bacteria interact constantly in a synergistic and competitive manner and any disturbances in this microbial community can cause bacterial overgrowth and disease [6] . Due to immunodeficiency and incomplete gut microbiota at birth, the neonatal piglets are particularly vulnerable to infectious enteric diseases [7] . However, recognition of the pathogenic bacteria in gut population and distinguishing from non-harmful microbiota is difficult and restricted by the fact that bacterial diversity is not yet fully explored and the pathogenic bacteria are also present in clinically healthy animals. Nevertheless, a few potentially pathogenic bacteria that are considered to be part of the normal intestinal microbiota, have been recently studied as a potential cause of neonatal enteritis. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the following bacteria: E. coli, Enterococcus spp., C. perfringens and C. difficile in naturally occurring pig neonatal diarrhea not caused by known enteric pathogens. For detection of these bacteria we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) targeting ribosomal RNA as this is a rapid and reliable method that allows a direct visualization, identification and spatial localization of bacteria within fixed tissue samples [8, 9] ."
20847,Spherules and IBV,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a gammacoronavirus that infects poultry primarily, causing an infectious respiratory disease. In addition, infection results in substantial economic losses to the worldwide poultry industry as a result of reduced egg quality, egg production, and meat quality. Although vaccines are available, there is a large degree of variation between strains of IBV and poor cross-protection. As a result, novel strategies are required to develop more effective vaccines. To enable this, it is important to understand the interaction between the virus and the host cell, allowing future manipulation and targeted attenuation of the virus by reverse genetics to develop vaccine strains. A critical step in the replication of all positive sense single stranded RNA (+RNA) viruses is the induction of cellular membrane rearrangements, providing the virus with a platform for the assembly of replication complexes responsible for synthesizing viral RNA. It can be considered that a site for viral RNA synthesis would provide an enclosed environment that protects viral RNA from cellular detection, preventing host degradation of RNA and preventing cellular immune stimulation. However, the site must also allow for the exchange of material with the cytoplasm. Nucleotides and other cellular reagents must enter to allow RNA synthesis to occur and viral RNA must exit for translation and assembly of new virus particles. In broad terms, the type of membrane rearrangements induced by different +RNA viruses can be split into two groups: double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and spherules. 1 Viruses that induce DMV type structures include poliovirus (PV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). In PV infected cells, single membrane structures are induced early in infection, followed by double membrane structures. 2 They seem to be derived from the cellular ER and viral replicase proteins have been found to localize to the cytoplasmic side of both single and double membrane structures. 2, 3 In the case of HCV, DMVs are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and at early time points, the outer membrane remains attached to the ER. By later time points, the DMVs appear to bud and become free vesicles. The majority of DMVs were found to be sealed from the cytoplasm with only 10% having a visible pore from the interior. 4 Viruses that induce spherule type structures, or invaginated vesicles, include Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Flock House virus (FHV), Brome Mosaic virus (BMV), and the Flaviviruses Dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV). For all of these viruses, the spherule-like structure is composed of an invagination of a single membrane derived from a cellular structure. SFV induces spherules at the plasma membrane early in infection, which later become internalized as part of the endo/lysosomal pathway. 5 FHV induces spherules on the outer mitochondrial membrane 6 and BMV, DENV, and WNV all induce spherules or invaginated vesicles on the ER. 7-10 For each virus, replicase proteins and RNA have been found to localize to spherules 5, 8, 9, 11 and there is an 8-10 nm pore connecting the spherule interior with the cytoplasm. 6, 9, 10, 12 It has long been characterized that in continuous cell culture, coronaviruses induce the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and branching networks of membranes known as convoluted membranes. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] These structures have been identified in cells infected with three different betacoronaviruses: mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. DMVs provide an enclosed environment and have historically been proposed as the site of assembly of viral replication complexes. Some viral replicase proteins have been shown to be located inside DMVs or on their membranes. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] In addition, virus associated dsRNA, a potential replicative intermediate, is located on the interior of DMVs. 18 In more recent work utilizing electron tomography allowing 3D reconstruction of membrane structures, it was demonstrated that in SARS-CoV infected continuous cell culture, these structures are derived from and remain connected to the cellular ER. 18 In addition, using this technique Knoops et. al. were able to study in detail the membrane continuity of these vesicles. Interestingly, they were unable to find any pores or connections between the interior of the DMV and the cell cytoplasm. 18 This raised the question, if DMVs are the site of RNA synthesis, how does newly synthesized RNA exit the compartment?"
21343,The Porcine MicroRNA Transcriptome Response to Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Infection,"TGEV is highly contagious and can spread through various channels; however, the main infection route this virus is fecal-oral. At present, the virus is distributed worldwide; the prevalence of TGEV in different regions of China has long been reported, and TGEV infection has caused huge economic losses to the swine industry."
21554,A Novel Pathogenic Mammalian Orthoreovirus from Diarrheic Pigs and Swine Blood Meal in the United States,"The ongoing outbreaks of epidemic piglet diarrhea have devastated the swine industry in the United States, with significant economic losses. Since a federal mandate to report the SECD cases on 5 June 2014, a total of 731 swine premises had been confirmed positive until 22 January 2015 in the United States (22) . Strict and intensive biosecurity measures have been adopted on many farms to control SECD, but the disease spread is unabated, and at least 32 states are now affected. Repeated outbreaks in previously infected herds were also reported, suggesting that the SECoVs may not be the sole agents responsible for this unprecedented epidemic diarrhea outbreak in the United States and other countries, including Mexico, Japan, Canada, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador (6) , and Ukraine (7). Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel MRV3 from SECD fecal samples and swine blood meal, which is a by-product of the slaughtering industry and is used as a protein source in the diets of livestock. We also provide evidence that these novel MRV3 strains are pathogenic to neonatal pigs, leading to lethal enteric disease. More than 80% of ring-dried blood meal feed supplements and 37.5% of the fecal samples from epidemic diarrheic pigs tested in this study were found positive for the novel MRV3. It remains to be determined whether porcine MRV3 is responsible, either primarily or in combination with SECoV, for the current uncontrollable epidemic piglet diarrhea. There have been conflicting reports on the presence of live pathogenic SECoVs in porcine blood products (23, 24) . The World Organization for Animal Health Office International des Epizooties (OIE) ad hoc group on PEDV recently concluded that contaminated pig blood products, including spray-dried plasma are not a likely source of infectious PEDV (2, 25) as spray-drying typically inactivates enveloped coronaviruses. Therefore, the presence of chloroform-resistant, infectious MRV3 in RDSB as identified in this study is of great significance considering the current difficulties in arresting the spread of this economically important disease in the U.S. and Canadian swine industries."
21789,Porcine epidemic diarrhea: a review of current epidemiology and available vaccines,"After spring 2013, PED was no longer found only in Asia. US scientists who had not researched PEDV began to study this disease, which had previously not been a problem in Ame ri can. From this, a PED vaccine reflecting the genetic charac teristics of the PEDV strain isolated during the US outbreak was commercialized [14] . Moreover, many veterinary scien tists have focused on the development of more effective PED vaccines because of the major economic losses associated with PED outbreaks. After the US outbreak, sporadic PED out South Korean, piglets < 1 week of age died from severe watery diarrhoea after showing signs of dehydration. After the acute outbreak, piglets were anorectic, depressed, vomiting, and producing water faeces that did not contain any signs of blood. (C) Necropsies of deceased piglets from the Gimpo outbreak uncovered gross lesions in the small intestines, which were typically fluidic, distended, and yellow, containing a mass of curdled, undigested milk. Atrophy of the villi caused the walls of the small intestines to become thin and almost transparent. (D) Yellowish watery diarrhea in sucling piglets after acute infection of PEDV. breaks occurred in Germany. Therefore, European countries were not isolated from the spread of the US PEDV [15] . Thus, the US outbreak was important turning point in PED research, and PED research can be said to be divided into two eras: be fore and after 2013."
21789,Porcine epidemic diarrhea: a review of current epidemiology and available vaccines,"For the prevention of PEDV infection, several vaccines have been reported in Asian countries; the predominance of vac cines in Asian countries, but not in Europe or America, is thou ght to be related to the occurrence of severe PED outbreaks and major economic losses in Asia [7] . Commercial PEDV vaccines include live attenuated vaccines and binary ethyl enimine (BEI) inactivated vaccines. Some of these vaccines have been combined with vaccines for TGEV (a bivalent vac cine) and porcine RV (a trivalent vaccine) and used in China and South Korea [7, 25] . Moreover, an attenuated virus vac cine using cell cultureadapted PEDV has been administered to sows in Japan since 1997. Oral vaccination with a cellat tenuated vaccine has been used in South Korea since 2004 and in the Philippines since 2011 [7] . Although these commer cial vaccines are considered effective and have been widely used, not all animals develop solid lactogenic immunity. Sev eral factors are thought to be associated with the poor lacto genic immunogenicity of the commercial vaccine, including the immunizing route of the vaccine. Song et al. [73] demon strated that oral inoculation of PEDVseronegative pregnant sows with live attenuated PEDV reduces the mortality of suck ling piglets more effectively rather than injection after chal lenge, and this protection is associated with elevated IgA con centrations in colostrum and milk. Despite the reduction in mortality rates in piglets delivered from orally vaccinated sows, there was no shortening of the duration of virus shedding and no reduced severity of diarrhea after challenge between vac cinated and control pigs. Thus, some researchers may con clude that passive immunity by vaccination with the highly attenuated PEDV strain DR13 does not prevent virus shedding after challenge. Protection against virus challenge in conven tional pigs is related to the inoculation dose of the virus in the vaccine and the challenge dose of the virulent virus. At low doses of the attenuated PEDV, 25% of pigs are protected against PEDV challenge; however, this proportion increases to 50% when pigs are inoculated with a dose 20 times higher [74] . Moreover, loss of body weight and the content of viral shed ding decrease in orally vaccinated pigs compared with those in intramuscularly vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs follow ing challenge with a low dose of virulent virus (1 LD50, 10 3.0 TCID50/dose). Additionally, the lethal dose of PEDV changes depending on the body weights of the infected piglets and in fection of sows with the challenge virus (data not shown)."

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, sp. Avian coronavirus) belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and genus Gammacoronavirus. In India, vaccination against IB is carried out using Massachusetts 41 (Ma41) strain. Different IBV variants have emerged causing nephropathogenic and reproductive problems which infected the vaccinated flocks and hence it demands a dramatic change in vaccination programmes. IB is known to be one of the major contagious diseases of the respiratory and urogenital tract of chickens [7, 13] . IBV is a very dynamic and evolving virus, causing major economic losses to the global poultry industry [1] ."
21955,"Isolation and molecular characterization of nephropathic infectious bronchitis virus isolates of Gujarat state, India","IB is one of the most economically significant diseases of the intensive poultry industry in the world. Vaccination programmes rely mainly on the use of the Massachusetts strain, which is the most commonly used IBV vaccine strain in India; however, presence of the disease in vaccinated chickens is commonly observed, causing a major economic impact all over the world [12] . There is no detailed information available on the genetic makeup of any of the IBV strains used in the commercial vaccines. Since the IBV vaccines or the vaccine strains used in Indian poultry population are usually imported from abroad, it is always advisable to use an indigenous IBV vaccine strain as the immuno-prophylactic agent against prevailing field strains. Isolation of IBV by passaging the tissue samples in embryonated SPF eggs is a simple method. Dwarfing and curling signs were suggestive of presence of IBV [3, 16] . RT-PCR technique is increasingly being used to identify the spike glycoprotein genotype of IBV field strains and found to be very specific and sensitive for the detection of IBV [9, 11, 15, 16] ."
21990,The early immune response to infection of chickens with Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) in susceptible and resistant birds,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens first described in the USA in the 1930's [1] [2] [3] . Clinical signs include: coughing, sneezing, rales and nasal discharge. The disease can also affect the reproductive organs, which leads to a decrease in egg quality and production, thus making it a major cause of economic losses within the poultry industry [4] . The causative virus, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) is a coronavirus, which is an enveloped virus with a single positive-stranded RNA genome, which replicates in the host cell cytoplasm [5] . Proteins encoded by IBV include the viral RNA polymerase, structural spike proteins, membrane and nucleocapsid and various other regulatory proteins. The spike glycoprotein mediates cell attachment and plays a significant role in host cell specificity [6] ."
22040,Strengthening epidemiologic investigation of infectious diseases in Korea: lessons from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak,"Korea recently experienced an unprecedented outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), in which it became the country with the second most confirmed patients worldwide, after Saudi Arabia. During this outbreak, which caused massive economic damage and social disruption throughout the country, the importance of preventive measures against the spread of infectious diseases from abroad, such as quarantine and epidemiologic investigations, became increasingly clear. The purpose of conducting epidemiologic investigations when an outbreak of an infectious disease such as MERS occurs is to promptly confirm the outbreak and to identify the causes and sources of infection. Ultimately, the goal is to prevent the spread of the infectious disease. The importance of epidemiologic investigations lies not only in the fact that they effectively prevent the spread of the ongoing infectious disease, but also in the fact that they provide information allowing the prediction and prevention of potential outbreaks in the future. The effective implementation of epidemiologic investigations requires the presence of a solid infrastructure including a national response system for infectious diseases, sufficient investment in public health institutions, high-quality operational management, and, above all, policies that support the training and retention of highly qualified personnel."
22040,Strengthening epidemiologic investigation of infectious diseases in Korea: lessons from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak,"In the early phase of the outbreak, the concept of cohort isolation was very unfamiliar and the ethical and legal grounds for cohort isolation were not robust. Moreover, general compliance was low. However, as the outbreak caused economic losses and social disruption, the general public reached a consensus that made it easier to implement drastic measures to prevent the further transmission of MERS. The support of local governments was also very helpful. Local governmental institutions agreed that timely and proper preventive measures were the best policy for handling the outbreak. In particular, the events that occurred on Jeju Island are worthy of close attention. A probable MERS case traveled to Jeju Island while symptomatic. Discrepancies were observed between his statements and those of his companions. Additional measures were taken due to these inconsistencies, including location tracking using the base stations of mobile phones and checking credit card bills. In addition, the automative navigation system of a rental car that a MERS case used while traveling was used to track that case's movements. These were new methods that had not been used in previous epidemiological investigations."
22116,Estimates and determinants of economic impacts from influenza‐like illnesses caused by respiratory viruses in Australian children attending childcare: a cohort study,"Conclusions For families with a child attending childcare, ILIs cause a substantial economic burden. An ILI in a child with working parents and/or with longer duration appears to cost more in monetary terms. Healthcare visits were increased if the child was non-Caucasian, lived in a detached house, had working parents or had a virus-positive ILI. Our findings on the estimates and determinants of economic impacts from respiratory virus infection highlight the importance and feasibility of an interdisciplinary (epidemiology/health economics) approach to such research."
22116,Estimates and determinants of economic impacts from influenza‐like illnesses caused by respiratory viruses in Australian children attending childcare: a cohort study,"Respiratory virus infection causes significant morbidity and mortality in the paediatric population. [1] [2] [3] It also results in substantial economic burden in terms of healthcare visits, including general practitioner (GP) and specialist consultations, medications, work absenteeism (either to care for a sick child or due to secondary illness in a carer) and hospitalisations. 4, 5 Attending childcare is likely to increase the risk of respiratory infection and costs associated with respiratory viruses: by providing an opportunity for respiratory virus transmission between children and because carers are required to miss work or leisure activities to either care for a sick child or recuperate from their own illness due to intrahousehold transmission. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 50% of children aged three attend childcare, with an average attendance of 17 hours per week, and 13% of children attending 35 hours or more a week. 6 According to the National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines in Australia, 7 children with influenza-like illness (ILI) need to be excluded from childcare until they have recovered."
22116,Estimates and determinants of economic impacts from influenza‐like illnesses caused by respiratory viruses in Australian children attending childcare: a cohort study,"To provide accurate and timely information about the economic impacts of respiratory virus infections in childcare, we present here the estimates and determinants of virusspecific costs from respiratory infections using a societal perspective and based on the findings from a prospective cohort study."
22116,Estimates and determinants of economic impacts from influenza‐like illnesses caused by respiratory viruses in Australian children attending childcare: a cohort study,"We conducted multivariate analyses (with STATA/SE 12.0; StataCorp LP, USA) to assess the association between the economic outcome of ILI and (i) demographic characteristics; (ii) ILI duration, and (iii) virological outcome variables. Due to the non-normality (right skewing) of the total cost variable in our study, a Tobit regression model was employed to determine variables that drive the ILI costs. 15 We also used a zero-inflated Poisson regression model 16 for comparing the counts of healthcare visits per ILI (that has an excess of zero counts) with demographic variables, ILI duration and virological outcomes. Subgroup analysis of ILI costs was performed based on the four groups of fever grading: 37Á8-<38°C, 38-<39°C, 39-<40°C and ≥40°C, using STATA/SE."
22116,Estimates and determinants of economic impacts from influenza‐like illnesses caused by respiratory viruses in Australian children attending childcare: a cohort study,"Limitations include the fact that study children and families were not representative of the broader Australian population. Most (89%) study children attended childcare, and compared with the general Australian population, 14 study households had higher income (Table 2) , leading to an under-representation of lower-income households. Previous Australian research has shown that the highest mean acute respiratory illness (ARI) cost-of-illness values are not necessarily associated with the highest income households, reducing the likelihood our study population may have upwardly biased mean ILI costs. In addition, as shown in Table 2 , the mothers in our study were slightly older (33 years compared with 30 years in the general population 17 ) and they were more likely to live with a partner (married or de facto) (97% versus 88%). 18 This study showed a low prevalence of A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2010. We believe this is partly because we did not start collecting ILI data until 30 July 2010, thus, some winter cases of influenza may have been missed. Surveillance data revealed that the 2010 influenza peak was September in the state where we conducted the study (NSW), 19 but the incidence of influenza in 2010 was relatively low. 19 It is noteworthy that we used a relatively comprehensive approach to collect information on the costs of ILI, and our study reinforced the importance of indirect costs in economic assessment of infectious diseases. Apart from the major cost drivers (i.e. time off work, healthcare visits), we also collected data on other cost items; these included non-antibiotic prescription medication, OTC medications, and paid childcare for other children (in the same household of the ILI child), whilst carers were looking after the sick child, travel costs of healthcare visits and all other costs that the carers recalled. In addition, our study highlighted that the time off recreational activities should be adequately measured because it covered a not insubstantial 19% (3/16 hours) of total time lost."
22116,Estimates and determinants of economic impacts from influenza‐like illnesses caused by respiratory viruses in Australian children attending childcare: a cohort study,"Our study identified some novel variables associated with ILI costs and more healthcare visits for the ILI. Having both parents in paid employment increased the ILI costs probably due to the primary carer and the partner taking time off work to look after the sick child. The lost productivity due to time off work plus costs of recreation time lost accounted for the majority of ILI costs in this study that is consistent with the literature. 20, 21 In our study, particularly where both parents work, even simple ILIs without a GP visit can be costly because of carers' taking time off work. Apart from economic impact, qualitative interviews conducted with a subsample of the carers in this study also demonstrated that these parents have larger quality-of-life impact in terms of daily and social life disruption. 22 To our knowledge, ours is the first study that demonstrates the duration of respiratory infection, when managed outside a hospital, is associated with higher economic costs. This finding may suggest that for future efforts in assessing the economic impacts of a respiratory disease, the measurement of infection duration should be taken into account as a proxy for economic burden. Of the four variables that increased the number of healthcare visits with an ILI, we believe that two of them (living in a detached house and having working parents) are associated with potentially higher socio-economic status. In the literature, it is evident that those of higher economic class are more likely to seek medical visits for their health issues. [23] [24] [25] However, our study did not collect related information to prove the potential link between socioeconomic status and health-seeking behaviours."
22116,Estimates and determinants of economic impacts from influenza‐like illnesses caused by respiratory viruses in Australian children attending childcare: a cohort study,"In our study, the children with virus-positive ILIs had more healthcare visits than those with no virus detected; however, among the virus-positive ILIs, the number of healthcare visits did not significantly increase with increasing number of viruses identified. The use of RT-PCR has contributed to ongoing discovery/detection of simultaneous multiple respiratory pathogens from a single specimen in one child, 26 but the real impact of these simultaneous detections remains unclear. There are some reports documenting that (i) the single infection of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and (ii) the co-infection of HMPV plus respiratory syncytial virus increase hospitalisation rates, 27, 28 while other studies did not detect an association between a multiple viral infections and illness severity. [29] [30] [31] Future research should endeavour to better correlate clinical/economic disease severity with viral quantity. In valuing the recreation time lost, we used sex-weighted mean income in Australia. There is some controversy on the valuation of recreation time. 32, 33 An economic analysis using a societal perspective requires that all costs resulting from an illness should be taken into account, regardless of who experiences the costs 34 ; thus, we believe measuring and valuing all time spent on an ILI episode are important, including that removed from recreation. The recreation time loss is likely to cause opportunity costs, which needs to be assessed in an economic analysis."
22116,Estimates and determinants of economic impacts from influenza‐like illnesses caused by respiratory viruses in Australian children attending childcare: a cohort study,"In summary, this study's finding of a substantial social and economic burden of ILI in children attending childcare highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in providing primary data for policy making of a possible preventive programme for respiratory infections. To link the disease impact and economic assessment results, interdisciplinary research (epidemiology and health economics) is needed to better assess the desirability and feasibility of preventive or therapeutic interventions."
22285,Coronaviruses: emerging and re-emerging pathogens in humans and animals,"Besides humans, coronaviruses also cause various diseases in animals with some resulting in significant economic losses. PEDV, a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, is the etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea in swine populations. The disease was endemic in Asia and European countries in the past decades. In 2013, the virus has emerged or re-emerged to cause large-scale epidemics in the Americas and Asia, causing millions of fatal cases among piglets and representing one of the most serious concerns among the global pig industries [8, 9] . The ability of epidemic PEDV strains to emerge despite current vaccination schemes suggests that the virus is able to evolve and escape from immune protection."
22288,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus: An emerging and re-emerging epizootic swine virus,"Since the 1990s, PED cases have become rare in Europe and PED virus (PEDV)-associated diarrhea has been usually observed in adult pigs, whereas suckling piglets were generally spared or developed only mild symptoms [6] . PED was first reported in Asia in 1982 and since then it has had a great economic impact on the Asian pork industry [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In contrast to the present situation in Europe, PED epizootics in Asia are more severe causing high mortality in neonatal piglets and the disease has become an endemic pattern recently. However, despite a notorious reputation in Asian swineproducing countries, PED was not a well-known disease worldwide. For example, the disease had never occurred in the United States until 2013. In May 2013, PED suddenly appeared in the United States and rapidly spread across the country, as well as to Canada and Mexico, causing deaths of more than 8 million newborn piglets in the United States alone during a 1 year-epidemic period [12] [13] [14] [15] . Subsequently, severe PED outbreaks recurred in Asian countries including South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan [16] [17] [18] . PEDV has now emerged or re-emerged as one of the most devastating viral diseases of swine in the world, leading to significant financial concerns in the global pork industry."
22288,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus: An emerging and re-emerging epizootic swine virus,"Although PEDV first appeared in the United Kingdom and spread to other European countries in the 1970s, the disease impact caused by PEDV in Europe and its economic importance were negligible compared to its effects on the industry in Asian countries and the United States. Over the last decades, therefore, the presence of PEDV was not intensely studied. In 1980s and 1990s, PEDV outbreaks became infrequent, while the virus persisted in an endemic form in the pig population at a low rate. Sporadic outbreaks were reported in some European countries, causing diarrhea in weaner or feeder pigs. A number of serological surveys indicated that seroprevalence of PEDV had become low in European pigs [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . Interestingly, despite low immunity of pigs in European countries, the virus has not been causing severe outbreaks in these susceptible populations although the exact resistance mechanism has not been elucidated. However, PEDV that affected in pigs of all ages, including suckling piglets, re-emerged in a typical epidemic form in Italy in 2006 [74] . In 2014, a case of PED, which occurred on a fattening farm, was reported in Germany [63] . Shortly thereafter, outbreaks of PEDV were identified in a farrow-finish herd in France and in fattening pigs in Belgium [64, 65] . These German, French, and Belgian PEDV strains were found to be genetically almost identical to each other (99.9 % identity) and most closely related to G1b variants identified in China, the United States, and South Korea (Fig. 3) . Further surveillance studies are needed to determine whether the G1b strains have already been circulating in Europe or were recently introduced from the United States or Asia. Since PED outbreaks may occur periodically in those countries, the implementation of proper biosecurity protocols would be necessary in order to prevent further spread of PEDV domestically or internationally in Europe. In addition, it would be important to investigate if high virulent G2 PEDV is present in certain areas of Europe. "
22288,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus: An emerging and re-emerging epizootic swine virus,"The first PED epizootic in South Korea was confirmed in 1992 [8] . However, a retrospective study revealed that PEDV already existed since as early as 1987 [83] . PED outbreaks have since occurred every year and became endemic, which resulted in high rates of death among piglets and substantial economic losses to domestic swine industry until 2010. In a serological survey carried out in 2007, 91.8 % of 159 tested farms had sero-positive pigs in wean to finish periods (30-150 days of age), indicating that the majority of farms were affected with endemic PEDV infection [84] . Since early 2000s, both modified attenuated and inactivated vaccines based on domestic isolates SM98-1 or DR-13 have been introduced nationwide, leading to a decline in the incidence of PEDV-associated diarrheal disease outbreaks compared to the past years. However, continuous PED epidemics in vaccinated farms have raised problems related to the efficacy of Korean commercial vaccines. PED isolates, which prevalently circulated in South Korea during the same period, were classified as G2a strains that contained S indels compared to CV777 and were distantly related to CV777 or Korean vaccine strains belonging to the G1a subgroup [26] ."
22288,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus: An emerging and re-emerging epizootic swine virus,"Vaccination of sows is a fundamental tool in a strategy to control and eradicate PED during epidemic or endemic outbreaks. Piglets are then protected by a transfer of maternal antibodies via colostrum and milk from immune dams. Although PED first emerged in Europe, the disease has not caused sufficient economic losses to justify the vaccine development. In contrast, PED outbreaks in Asian countries have been serious, and therefore several PEDV vaccines have been developed. In China, CV777-attenuated or -inactivated vaccines have been routinely applied against PED. Attenuation of the virulence of the Japanese PEDV strain 83P-5 was achieved after 100 passages in Vero cells [27] . Subsequently, the cell-adapted 83P-5 strain has been employed as an intramuscular (IM) live virus vaccine (P-5 V) in Japan and it is now also available in South Korea. The cell-culture adaptation method was also applied to attenuate two South Korean virulent PEDV strains, SM98-1 (93 passages) and DR-13 (100 passages) [107, 108] . The SM98-1 strain has been used as an IM live or killed vaccine, whereas DR-13 is available as an oral live vaccine. Although these attenuated or inactivated vaccines have been demonstrated to provide protection under experimental conditions, their effectiveness in the field, as well as pros and cons of their use, are still being debated. In South Korea, the multiple dose vaccination program (3 or 4 IM administrations of vaccines in the following order: live-killed-killed or live-live-killed-killed, correspondingly) at 2-or 3-week intervals starting before farrowing or mating is commonly recommended in pregnant sows or gilts to maintain high levels of neutralizing antibodies in serum and colostrum [90, 91] . Recently, the Korean Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency evaluated the efficacy of domestic and imported PED vaccines commercially available in South Korea. The administration of each commercial vaccine according to corresponding manuals (twice at both 3 and 5 weeks prior to farrowing) increased the survival rate of piglets challenged with a virulent wild-type PEDV from 18.2 % to over 80 %. However, all vaccines did not significantly reduce the morbidity rate of diarrhea including virus shedding in feces [109] . Although protection against the enteric disease is primarily dependent on the presence of secretory IgA antibodies in the intestinal mucosa, the vaccine efficacy might be associated with maintaining high levels of PEDV-specific neutralizing antibodies in the serum and colostrum of vaccinated sows [90, 91, 109] . In addition to a direct vaccination, another crucial aspect is passive colostral and lactogenic immunity of neonatal piglets by ample quantities of protective antibodies obtained from sow colostrums and milk. Thus, sanitation and health conditions of lactating sows have to be monitored to eliminate potential factors negatively affecting lactation performance, such as mastitis or agalactia, so that sows could constantly provide high-quality colostrum and milk to their litters. Suckling piglets lose their source of lactogenic immunity at weaning and soon thereafter become vulnerable to PEDV. Following an acute PED epidemic, the virus may persist in susceptible animals or pigs that survived, leading to the circulation of the virus on the farm (endemic PED). Thus, active immunization of weaner to finisher pigs may be necessary for the control of endemic PEDV infections [6] ."
22288,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus: An emerging and re-emerging epizootic swine virus,"For the last two or three decades, PED has continued to plague the pork industry in Europe and Asia. In early 2013, the disease struck North America resulting in great economic losses, especially in the United States. Shortly thereafter, massive nationwide PED outbreaks reoccurred in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. PED is now globally recognized as an emerging and re-emerging disease and it has become a major financial issue for the swine industry worldwide. Despite geographically limited PED studies in Europe and Asia, a better knowledge of the virology, pathogenesis, immunology, epidemiology, and vaccinology has been gained. Since the emergence of PED in North America, much has been learned from research in the United States. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted to decipher the virus and the associated disease, and more extensive academic and practical studies are needed for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and pathogenic biology of PEDV in order to develop effective vaccines and establish control measures including biosecurity in affected areas. Lastly, we should bear in mind that a combined application of vaccines, biosecurity protocols, and husbandry management must be the key step to prevent and control PED. Integrated and coordinated efforts in various disciplines among researchers, swine veterinarians, producers, swine industry specialists, producer associations, and authorities are required to achieve effective implementation of necessary measures."
22607,Wildlife Trade and Human Health in Lao PDR: An Assessment of the Zoonotic Disease Risk in Markets,"The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is home to a rich diversity of wildlife, including mammal, reptile, bird and amphibian species of national or global importance along with high rates of endemism [9] . However, populations are increasingly threatened by high levels of hunting for domestic and international wildlife trade and by habitat loss [9] . Wildlife throughout Lao PDR is declining with many populations now at alarmingly low levels [9] . Wild sources of protein have been an important dietary component for some communities in Lao PDR for generations, but the scale of this practice was relatively small, and limited to subsistence consumption. However, beginning in the early 1980s wildlife began to be traded in wet markets (where live animals or fresh meat are sold, as in this study) and gained momentum after 1986 with the economic opening of the country following inception of the New Economic Mechanism [10] , suggesting there is an appetite for wildlife in Lao PDR that is unrelated to subsistence consumption. Wildlife is primarily sold for food, but also for traditional medicine, pets and ornaments [10] . The high volume of wildlife and diversity of species traded in Lao PDR markets has been documented [11] [12] [13] [14] , but no studies have evaluated the human health risk posed by such trade."
22607,Wildlife Trade and Human Health in Lao PDR: An Assessment of the Zoonotic Disease Risk in Markets,"We assessed the potential for zoonotic pathogens to be transmitted from wildlife to humans at markets in Lao PDR by looking at the following: Factor 1 -potential for wildlife and human contact (based on observed volume of wildlife in markets), Factor 2 -potential for traded wildlife to carry a zoonotic pathogen (based on observed wildlife taxa traded and their previous documentation to be a host of a zoonotic pathogen) and Factor 3 -opportunities for pathogen transmission from infected wildlife to humans (based on observed biosafety practices or lack thereof in markets). We then assessed Factor 4 -potential for human spread of a disease from markets to wider populations (based on market location and origin of market visitors). To provide a combined One Health assessment of the impact of wildlife trade on public health and biodiversity, we included an assessment of conservation and socio-economic implications of wildlife trade in Lao PDR, by examining protection status and price of traded wildlife."
22607,Wildlife Trade and Human Health in Lao PDR: An Assessment of the Zoonotic Disease Risk in Markets,"Finally, we investigated the conservation and socio-economic implications of wildlife trade. We examined the conservation implications of wildlife trade by assessing the protection status of wildlife observed during the basic market surveys, according to the Lao PDR Wildlife and Aquatic Law and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Whether wildlife was purchased as a luxury versus subsistence food was examined through comparing the price of wildlife to a domestic commodity (pork). Data on the price of wildlife were collected during the detailed market surveys by listening to prices given to buyers. Price was recorded in Lao PDR Kip currency or converted from Thai Baht to Kip for analysis."

In particular, young calves are strongly affected by diarrhea and may die from malnutrition and dehydration depending on the situations [25] . The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that 57% of deaths of weaning calves in the US were because of diarrhea (http:// nahms.aphis.usda.gov/dairy/index.htm).

22713,A Dimerization-Dependent Mechanism Drives the Endoribonuclease Function of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus nsp11,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a member of the family Arteriviridae, which also includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (7) . PRRSV is the causative agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which has become one of the most important infectious diseases in the swine industry and causes tre-mendous economic losses worldwide (9, 10) . The PRRSV genome is approximately 15 kb in length, with 10 overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), and consists of both nonstructural genes (ORF1a and ORF1b) and structural genes (ORF2 to ORF7) (7, 11, 12) . ORF1a and ORF1b comprise approximately 80% of the viral genome and encode at least 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), including nsp1␣, nsp1␤, nsp2, nsp2TF/nsp2N, nsp3 to nsp6, nsp7␣, nsp7␤, and nsp8 to nsp12 (13) ; ORF2 to ORF7 encode the viral structural proteins GP2, E, GP3, GP4, GP5, ORF5a, M, and N (14, 15) . The resulting mature nsps direct viral genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription via a membrane-anchored replicase/transcriptase complex, and these mRNAs are then translated to produce structural and accessory proteins (12) . nsp9 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and nsp10 (helicase) (7) are the key replicative enzymes in the replicase/transcriptase complex; nsp11 (endoribonuclease) may also play a key role in arterivirus replication, though the exact function of endoribonucleases in nidovirus replication remains unclear (7, 16) ."

22915,"XXIV World Allergy Congress 2015: Seoul, Korea. 14-17 October 2015","Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Asian dust events on asthma by socioeconomic status using claim data. Methods: Case crossover design was used. This study is based on the national health insurance claim (ICD : J45, J46), air pollutants [PM 10 (μg/m 3 ), CO(ppb), SO 2 (ppb), NO 2 (ppb), O 3 (ppb)] and climate [temperature(°C), humidity(%), visibility(km), wind speed(m/s), air pressure(hPa)] data from 2007 to 2013 in Seoul and Incheon, Korea. The socioeconomic status was classified into health insurance group and medical aid group. The daily maximum value of air pollutants and daily average climate were calculated. The daily numbers of asthma cases on the 'Event' days were compared with 'Control' days. To select event days, 2 criteria were applied: 1) exclude weekends 2) excluded reoccurred Asian dust events on the 14 days before and after the Asian dust event. It was observed for 7 days after the events days. Control days is defined as the 7 days before and after the event days. Log poisson regression was used to estimate the ratio of averaged asthma cases using age, gender, region and climate between event and control days. Results: 7 event days were selected. On the event days, the average numbers of asthma cases were much more than the control days on the gender, age, region and socioeconomic status. However, there was no significant difference statistically. Humidity of the event days was lower (p=0.0950) but wind speed (p=0.0203) and PM 10 (p=0.0376) were higher than control days. The estimated ratio of averaged asthma cases on event days was 0.96 (95% C.I.: 0.95-0.98). According to the socioeconomic status, the ratio of asthma patients during 7 days from 'day +0' to 'day +6' were as follows: 0.96 (0.95 -0.97) on the day +0, 1.27 (1.26 -1.29 ) on the day +1, 1.11 (1.09 -1.13 ) on the day +2, 1.25 (1.23 -1.26) on the day +3, 1.13 (1.12 -1.15 ) on the day +4, 1.06 (1.04 -1.07) on the day +5 and 0.83 (0.81 -0.84) on the day +6 in the health insurance group. Also, in medical aids group, the estimated ratio of the each day were 1.00 (0.94 -1.07), 1.14 (1.06 -1.22), 1.15 (1.06 -1.25 ), 1.18 (1.11 -1.25 ), 1.08 (1.01 -1.15 ), 1.02 (0.94 -1.10) and 0.78 (0.74 -0.83). Conclusion: Asian dust events can worsen asthma and its effects on asthma appear differently by the socioeconomic status.

22915,"XXIV World Allergy Congress 2015: Seoul, Korea. 14-17 October 2015","Conclusion DANYOUNG classification has very simple, objective advantage and useful on early diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. When OMU-CT is using together for allergic rhinitis patient, this staging is clear more than. DANYOUNG classification 2015 update can related on ARIA 2010 update, can be one in the future. Background: Although many patients with allergic rhinitis have symptoms due to sensitization with more than one kind of allergens, and mixed allergen extracts are widely used for immunotherapy, there are few published trials. Methods: We performed a 1-year single-centre cohort study of subcutaneous immunotherapy using house dust mite extract, weed pollen extract, or mixed house dust mite/weed pollen extract in 44 allergic rhinitis patients. All the allergens responsible for the symptom of each patient were included in his immunotherapy. Quality of life was evaluated with the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) before and after 1-year immunotherapy. Results: After 1-year subcutaneous immunotherapy, RQLQ score of the house dust mite group 1.02±0.82(n=12)was significantly better than baseline RQLQ score 2.25±1.29 (p=0.024) ; RQLQ score for the weed pollen season of the weed pollen group 1.53±1.13 (n=21)was significantly better than baseline level 3.08±1.22 (p=0.000); RQLQ score for the weed pollen season of the mixed house dust mite/ weed pollen group 1.78±1.02 (n=11) was significantly better than baseline level 2.92±1.25 (p=0.004), RQLQ for ordinary times of the mixed house dust mite/weed pollen group 0.62±0.62 (n=11) was significantly better than baseline score 1.23±0.84 (p=0.002). The reduction of RQLQ score in the house dust mite group was 1.23±1.63, and 1.55±1.24 in the weed pollen group after 1-year treatment. In the mixed house dust mite/weed pollen group, RQLQ for ordinary times deceased by 0.60±0.47, with no difference compared to the house dust mite group (p=0.224); RQLQ for the weed pollen season decreased by 1.14±1.01, with no difference compared to the weed pollen group (p=0.358). Conclusions: There was no significant difference between the effect on quality of life of the mixed house dust mite/weed pollen extract immunotherapy and the effect of the house dust mite extract or the weed pollen extract immunotherapy. The efficacy of multi-allergen immunotherapy was not weaker than that of single-allergen immunotherapy. Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that desertification and climatic variability can contribute to increased desert dust formation in the air. Desert dust has been shown to exert adjuvant effects in animals. Objective: To examine if desert dust enhances allergic symptoms in real-life settings and to investigate its effect modifiers. Methods: We conducted a cohort study for 3,327 pregnant women during spring and fall in the period spanning October 2011 to May 2013 in three regions in Japan as an adjunct study of the Japan Environment & Children's Study. We timely acquired participants' daily symptom scores by sending a web-based questionnaire on high Background: There has been no nationwide population-based investigation of relationship between allergic rhinitis (AR) and mental health in Korea. Objective: To evaluate the association between AR and mental health status in the general adult Korean population. Also, to investigate relative burden of AR on mental health using Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) classification. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed by using data of 11,154 individuals 19 years old or older, collected through the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011 to 2012. Univariate analysis was conducted on Healthy, AR groups with weighted prevalence of demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status and comobid diseases. Subanalysis classifying AR severity according to the ARIA classification was carried out to evaluate the relationship of AR severity with mental health. The odds ratios (ORs) for each components representing mental health status were estimated by multiple logistic regression analyses with confounder adjustment. Results: Univariate analysis with Chi-square test after adjusting age, sex, BMI, smoking status, alcohol use status and exercise status, components representing mental health status showed linear trend with the severity of AR according to ARIA classification. Stress, depressive mood, suicidal thought, psychological consultation factors were correlated with AR after adjusting demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status. Even after adjusting comorbid allergic diseases the correlation remained significant with stress, depressive mood, psychological consultation factors (OR [95% CI]; 1.227 [1.042, 1.445 ], 1.368 [1.095, 1.71 ], 1.804 [1.096, 2.969] ). Conclusion: Patients with AR appear to be at a higher risk for mental health disorders in the general adult Korean population. Moreover, persistent or severe AR was correlated with poor mental health. Therefore, better control of AR may be conducive to better mental health and more attention should be paid to the psychological status of AR patients."
22915,"XXIV World Allergy Congress 2015: Seoul, Korea. 14-17 October 2015","Methods: Genetic association analysis of one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from each candidate region was performed in non-Hispanic white asthmatic subjects from SARP, CSGA, ACRN, and TENOR cohorts (n = 1,209 and 154 for atopic and non-atopic asthma, respectively) using logistic regression model. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis, using linear regression model, of the candidate SNPs was performed in cells from human bronchial epithelial biopsy (BEC, n = 107) and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL, n = 94) from the SARP cohort (GEO series accession number GSE67940). Results: SNPs in seven genes (IL18R1, LPP, SLC25A46, WDR36, HLA-DQB1, C11orf30, and CLEC16A) were associated with general physician-diagnosed asthma in the GABRIEL study (P = 3.5x10 -12 -4.4x10 -3 ) (Moffatt, NEJM, 2010). In our study, SNPs in five genes (IL18R1, LPP, IL21, TLR6, and C11orf30) were associated with atopic status in asthma subjects (P = 4.6x10 -3 -0.05). SNPs in LPP and IL21 showed opposite risk alleles between asthma and autoimmune diseases. The gene expression pattern between BEC and BAL were distinct. In BAL, rs1464510, rs7696175, rs1043828, rs6906021, and rs7936562 were cis-correlated with mRNA expression levels of LPP, TLR6, TSLP, HLA-DQB1, and C11orf30, respectively (P = 1.1x10 -10 -0.04). Conclusions: Most of the genes associated with allergic sensitization or self-reported allergic rhinitis are also associated with general asthma, indicating shared genetic factors among allergic diseases. IL18R1, LPP, and C11orf30-LRRC32 are associated with atopic asthma and general asthma, however, the association effects (odds ratio) are stronger in atopic asthma. IL21 and TLR6 are associated with atopic status in asthma, but not associated with general asthma, indicating the importance to perform genetic analysis in more homogeneous asthma subphenotypes. Asthma and autoimmune diseases have shared immunopathogenesis pathways but in opposite directions. There is a tissue-specific gene expression regulation. Background: The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), identified as a molecular target for the activation of sensory neurons by various painful stimuli, was reported to play a role in signaling and activation of CD4 + T cells. However, the role of TRPV1 remains poorly understood in allergic rhinitis. Objective: To exploit the role of TRPV1 using TRPV1 antagonist such as N-(4-Tertiarybutylphenyl)-4-(3-cholorphyridin-2-yl)tetrahydropyrazine -1(2H)-carboxamide (BCTC) and TRPV1 knockout mice in allergic rhinitis mice models and using samples of patients with allergic rhinitis and to evaluate the molecular mechanism of TRPV1 in CD4+ T cell mediated signaling pathway in allergic rhinitis. Methods: TRPV1 expression was measured in CD4 + T cell and cytokine analysis and T cell receptor signaling pathways were evaluated in BCTC pretreated T cell lines and TRPV1 (-/-) T cells. Allergic parameters were evaluated using TRPV1 antagonists and TRPV1 knockout mice in OVA-challenged mice model. Additionally, TRPV1 expressions were assessed in patients with allergic rhinitis. Results: TRPV1 expression was localized in CD4 + T cell. BCTC pretreatment and TRPV1 knockout suppressed T cell cytokine production and suppressed T cell receptor signaling pathways, including NF-kB, MAP kinase and NFAT signaling in both Jurkat cell line and CD4 + T cells in vitro. TRPV1 antagonists (BCTC and theobromine) significantly reduced allergic parameters such as symptoms, totaland ova-specific IgE levels in the mice model of allergic rhinitis. In TRPV1 knockout and BCTC treated mice, nasal eosinophil infiltration and nasal mucosal cytokines transcriptional activities were decreased, when compared OVA-challenged wild-type mice. In human nasal mucosa, TRPV1+ inflammatory cells was frequently observed. TRPV1/CD4 double positive inflammaotry cells were increased in nasal mucosa in patients with allergic rhinitis as compared with non-allergic rhinitis and normal controls. Conclusion: TRPV1 activation on CD4 + T cells is involved in TCR signaling and could be a novel therapeutic strategy in allergic rhinitis. Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) has a wide range of clinical aspects, and comorbid allergic diseases may accompany. We aimed to identify rhinitis phenotypes in school children and to predict the prognosis of developing bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). Methods: As a part of Children's HEalth and Environmental Research (CHEER) study, a prospective follow-up study for 4 years with every 2 year interval, 2,491 children aged 6 to 14 years-old were enrolled in the first survey. Among them, 512 children had current rhinitis, defined as parental-reported doctor-diagnosed rhinitis and having rhinitis symptoms in the last 12 months. Variables including age, sex, body mass index, parental allergic history, income, maternal education level, AR treatment during the last 12 months, environmental tobacco smoking exposure, total serum IgE levels, eosinophil percentage, diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and asthma, lung function tests, BHR to methacholine and skin prick tests were used in the latent class analysis. Results: We identified 4 phenotypes of rhinitis as the best fit in this study. Cluster types were characterized as ""non-atopy with low socioeconomic status"" (33% of sample, Cluster 1), ""atopy with normal lung function"" (39%, Cluster 2), ""atopy with impaired lung function"" (14%, Cluster 3), and ""non-atopy and high socioeconomic status"" (15%, Cluster 4). Total serum IgE levels and serum eosinophil percentages were highest in cluster 3. Children in cluster 3 showed highest prevalence of new development of BHR during 4-year follow-up (P=0.039). Conclusions: From rhinitis phenotypes, rhinitis cluster with high atopy and impaired lung function in children is associated with new development of BHR. This finding suggests that identification of distinctive rhinitis phenotype will help to prevent the progression of new development of BHR in the aspect of allergic march. Background: Anaphylaxis to food, drugs and diagnostic reagents have been increasingly reported in adult patients; however, its pathogenic mechanisms or an efficient diagnostic test have not been settled. Basophil activation test (BAT) using two activation markers, CD203c and CD63, has been readily used to assess basophil activation status. Considering that mast cell/basophil play an important role in anaphylaxis, we evaluated the basophil activation status using CD203c and CD63 expressions in anaphylaxis patients compared to allergic patients without anaphylaxis. Method: 41 patients with various allergic diseases including asthma/ rhinitis, chronic urticaria as well as anaphylaxis and 23 normal healthy controls (NC) were enrolled in the study. Allergic patients were divided into two groups: anaphylaxis (n=13) and non-anaphylaxis groups (n=28), based on the presence of anaphylaxis to different drugs, foods and diagnostic reagents. BAT using CD203c and CD63 expression was performed in baseline and after stimulation with anti-IgE or calcium (Ca 2+ ) ionophore. The BAT is based on double staining with anti-CD123 and anti-HLA-DR and subsequent determination of the percentage of activated basophils by flow cytometry. Results: Baseline % expressions of both CD203c (30.28±23.10 vs. 13.76 ±14.60, P=0.036) and CD63 (17.67±20.48 vs. 3.31±3.73, P=0.028) on basophils were significantly higher in anaphylaxis group compared to NCs, while no differences were noted in non-anaphylaxis group. When the positive cutoff value for a positive BAT result was defined as mean +2SD of CD203c expression, positive BAT rate tended to be higher in anaphylaxis group (38.46%) than in non-anaphylaxis group (17.85%, P=0.20), while no differences were noted in CD63 expression levels. There were no significant differences in baseline % expressions of CD203c and CD63 or those induced by anti-IgE/Ca 2+ ionophore according to age, sex, atopic status, total IgE and ECP levels. Conclusion: These findings suggest that increased basal activation status of basophils may contribute to develop anaphylaxis in adult patients regardless of atopy status, serum total IgE and ECP levels. BATs with applying each allergen will be useful to confirm the causative agent."

The score was higher before treatment, it was statically meaningful when it compared with after treatment scores (p<0.001). The STAI average score was 52,05 before treatment and 42.95 after it. There was a statistically meaningful difference between the anxiety score average before and after the treatment (p<0.0001). The anxiety score was higher before the treatment. Failure in symptom controlling in asthma can lead to depression. We think that these patients should be examined for psychological disor-Introduction & Objectives: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common debilitating problem worldwide. Despite its prevalence in the Middle East, very little data is available on the economic impact of CSU on the public health system. This study evaluates the direct medical costs of treating refractory CSU patients in Kuwait. It also evaluates the budget impact of omalizumab (monoclonal anti-IgE antibody) use in these patients. Methods: Prevalence of CSU was estimated through the Delphi method. Data regarding drug utilization and health care system utilization was collected retrospectively from charts of refractory CSU patients who were followed at the Al-Rashed Allergy center in Kuwait. Costs were calculated from a health system perspective. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted on the price and utilization of each cost component. Results: Before omalizumab use, the total direct costs of treating 1,293 refractory CSU patients was estimated to be 1, 072, 837 KD (US$ 3, 570, 185) per year, corresponding to around 829.7 KD per patient per annum (US$ 2,761). The total cost was principally generated by outpatient visits 1,072,837 KD; which corresponds to 82.45% of the total cost). After omalizumab use, the cost was estimated to be 4,654,800 KD (US$ 15,490,234) per year, corresponding to around 3,600 KD per patient per annum (US$ 11, 980) . The total cost was principally generated by omalizumab costs 4,762,895 KD; which corresponds to 97% of the total cost. All other direct costs of treating CSU patients were decreased after the use of omalizumab. Conventional medication costs and hospitalization costs were reduced by 90% and ER costs were reduced by 97%. Cost estimates were most sensitive to variations in the price and utilization of outpatient visits and the price of omalizumab. Conclusion: The economic burden of refractory CSU in Kuwait is high. The introduction of omalizumab on the health care system is costly because of its high price; however, omalizumab has proven to be effective and is driving all other direct costs down."
22915,"XXIV World Allergy Congress 2015: Seoul, Korea. 14-17 October 2015","In conclusion, this study supports that younger age is a risk factor for RSV bronchiolitis. The airway obstruction of RSV bronchiolitis seems to be more severe and have higher bronchodilator responsiveness. Infant pulmonary function may reflect disease severity, while we need to consider the affected factors when assessing the disease severity based on infant pulmonary function. Purpose: The role of PM 10 in development of allergic diseases remains controversial among epidemiological studies, partly due to the inability to control for spatial variations of large-scale risk factors. This study aims to investigate spatial correspondence between the level of PM 10 and allergic diseases at the sub-district level in Seoul, Korea, in order to evaluate whether the impact of PM 10 is observable and spatially varies across the sub-districts. Methods: PM 10 measurements at 25 monitoring stations in the city were interpolated to 424 sub-districts where annual inpatient and outpatient count data for three types of allergic diseases (atopic dermatitis, asthma and allergic rhinitis) were collected. We estimated multiple ordinary least square regression models to examine the association of the PM 10 level with each of the allergic diseases, controlling for various sub-district level covariates. Geographically weighted regression models were conducted to evaluate how the impact of PM 10 varies across the sub-districts. Results: PM 10 was found to be a significant predictor of atopic dermatitis patient count (p<0.01), with greater association when spatially interpolated at the sub-district level. No significant effect of PM 10 was observed on allergic rhinitis and asthma when socioeconomic factors were controlled for. Geographically weighted regression models revealed spatial variation of PM 10 effects on atopic dermatitis across the sub-districts in Seoul. The relationship of PM 10 levels to atopic dermatitis patient counts is found to be significant only in Gangbuk region (p<0.01), along with other covariates including average land value, poverty rate, level of education and apartment rate (p<0.01). Conclusions: Our findings imply that PM 10 effects on allergic diseases might not be consistent throughout Seoul. GIS-based spatial modeling techniques could play a role in evaluating spatial variation of air pollution impacts on allergic diseases at the sub-district levels, which could provide valuable guidelines for environmental and public health policymakers."
22915,"XXIV World Allergy Congress 2015: Seoul, Korea. 14-17 October 2015","Methods: The HealthNuts population-based cohort consists of 5300 children recruited at age 1 year. All infants underwent skin prick test to egg, peanut and sesame, and those sensitized had food challenges. At age 4 years, food challenges were repeated in those children previously identified as food allergic to determine persistence or resolution. Weight and height at 1 and 4 years were reported by parents from the child health record. Weight and height z-scores were determined from the World Health Organisation growth charts, standardised for age and sex. Multivariate linear regression models were fitted to examine the effect of food allergy and eczema at age 1 on weight and height z-scores at ages 1 and 4, adjusted for birthweight, prematurity, socioeconomic index, ethnicity and duration of breast feeding. Results: Compared to children with no food allergy or eczema, children with both eczema and food allergy at age 1 had lower weight (β=-0.217, p<0.001) and height (β=-0.206, p=0.008) at age 1 and lower weight at age 4 (β=-0.159, p=0.026) after controlling for potential confounders. There was no difference in children with only food allergy or only eczema. At age 1 the height differences were greater in those with egg allergy and eczema (weight β=-0.240, p<0.001; height β=-0.215, p=0.009) than with peanut allergy and eczema (weight β=-0.292, p=0.011; height β=-0.145, p=0.281) compared to those with no eczema or food allergy. The differences continued at age 4 for children with egg allergy and eczema at age 1 (weight: β=-0.162, p=0.032 height: β=-0.120, p=0.234), particularly those who had persistent egg allergy and eczema at age 4 (weight β=-0.277, p=0.061; height β=-0.490, p=0.013). Peanut allergy, with or without eczema, at age 1 was not associated with differences in weight or height at age 4. Conclusions: Children with IgE-mediated food allergy with eczema at age 1 have reduced growth parameters at age 1 and age 4, while eczema or food allergy alone was not associated with reduced growth. These results emphasise the need for adequate nutritional follow up in food allergic children in infancy, particularly those with eczema. Background: To preliminary determine the impact factors on the clinical efficacy by periodically follow-up visiting dust mite allergic asthma and rhinitis children with one year treatment of dust mite specific immunotherapy. Methods: All of 70 dust mite allergic asthma and rhinitis children with mild to moderate severity were enrolled (male 52, female 18, 4 to 14 years old) February to November in 2011. 57 patients took add-on therapy of sublingual dust mite specific immunotherapy (SLIT) while the other 13 patients with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). The patients were visited at the baseline period and followed up every three months to assess asthma control test (ACT), visual analog scale (VAS) of asthma and rhinitis symptom and spirometry for pulmonary function test. All the subjects were required to continuously record daily symptom and medication score (SMS) by diary card and to monitor morning and night peak expiratory flow value (PEFR) each day. The controller medication were adjusted to step up or down according to the control level. At the baseline period and after treatment for 6 months and 12 months, serum sIgE and sIgG4 to dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and dermatophagoides farinae, total IgE were determinated by enzyme-linked immunoassay with immunCAP system. Results: (1)The analysis of clinical efficacy of dust mite specific immunotherapy in allergic asthma and rhinitis children. 54 patients completed treatment for 12 months. The average daily SMS was used as the evaluation index, the clinical response to SIT (effective cases) at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after SIT were 72.2%, 75.9%, 81.5% and 87.0%, respectively. The ACT/C-ACT assessment, average daily SMS, VAS score, FEV1%pred, MMEF%pred, FEV1%pred, MMEF%pred were all improved than before treatment. (2)The analysis of the impact factors in the clinical efficacy of dust mite specific immunotherapy. The SMS at the baseline period, the asthma history and PEF%pred at the baseline period could affect the clinical efficacy of dust mite specific immunotherapy. Conclusions: 87.0% of the patients showed effective response to SIT for one year. The patients with higher baseline SMS, shorter asthma history and lower PEF%pred responsed more effectively to SIT. Background: While otitis media with effusion (OME) is a well-known disease entity of a chronic inflammatory disease of the middle ear space characterized by the accumulation of fluid, but allergic otitis media is still not well-recognized. Previous investigations have suggested that the composition of the inflammatory substrate in the effusions of allergic otitis media is similar to the late-phase allergic response seen elsewhere in the respiratory tract, such as in asthma and in allergic rhinitis. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the prior treatment of Der f can effect on the inflammatory response induced by the subsequent LPS infection and which signaling pathway is involved. Method: Primary human middle ear epithelial cells (HMEEC) were exposed to Der f crude body extract, LPS or both in different sequences, and the magnitude of each immunologic response produced by the HMEEC was compared. The mRNA expression level of mucin gene (MUC) 8, GM-CSF, TNF-a, TLR 4 and MD 2 were evaluated by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The MUC proteins level before and after knocking out the TLR 4 and MD2 via siRNA transfection were assessed by Western blot analysis. Accordingly, the involved cell signaling pathway was evaluated by Western blot analysis and confocal microscopic image. Results: The inflammatory response of cytokines (GM-CSF, TNF-a) and the expression of MUC 8 were augmented by the pretreatment of Der f followed by LPS, however, sequential treatment of HMEEC with LPS and Der f or adding together at the same time did not induce the same amount of response. The MUC expression was decreased by prior knockdown of TLR4 with siRNA but not by the MD2-siRNA. The MUC proteins level were increased by the pretreatment of Der f followed by LPS and decreased by the treatment of SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and Bay (NF-kB inhibitor). The nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) translocation was demonstrated in the pretreatment of Der f followed by LPS condition. Conclusion: Theses results suggest that Der f may act as a substitute for MD2 and make a strong augmentative response to the subsequent LPS infection. There was an increase in p38 and NF-kB activation within human middle epithelial cells, suggesting an important role for the development of OME in patients with concealed allergy airway sensitization. Objective. To determine the relationship between familial and personal antecedent of allergy, active smoking, and alcohol consumption with drug allergy in pregnant adolescents. Methods. We conducted research on 785 pregnant adolescents by means of a cross-sectional study. Data collection was performed by using a self-administered questionnaire. We evaluated the difference of drug-allergy risk in 785 pregnant adolescents through familial and personal antecedent of allergy, active smoking, and alcohol consumption, calculating Odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence intervals (95% CI) by both uni-and multivariate regression analyses. Results. Prevalence of drug allergy was 9.2% and of familial and personal antecedent of allergy, 8.7 and 21.0%, respectively. Percentage of active smoking was 17.6% and of alcohol consumption, 38.1%. Results of multivariate logistic regression analysis show that the familial history of atopic (Adjusted OR = 3.51; 95% CI = 1.85-6.29; p = 0.000), personal antecedent of allergy (Adjusted OR = 4.11; 95% CI = 2.48-6.81; p = 0.000), active smoking (Adjusted OR = 1.92; 95% CI = 1.10-3.35; p = 0.021), and alcohol consumption (Adjusted OR = 2.44; 95% CI = 1.48-4.06; p = 0.000), are significantly associated with drug allergy. Conclusion. Familial and personal antecedent of allergy, active smoking, and alcohol consumption appear to be important factors for development of drug allergy in pregnant adolescents aged 13-19 years. Background: REALISE Asia is a two-part study (Part 1 -patient survey and Part 2 -physician survey) conducted to understand patients' and physicians' perceptions and perspectives towards asthma and its management. We report here the extent of discrepancy in the understanding of well-controlled asthma between patients and physicians in Asia. Methods: REALISE Asia was conducted in two parts across the following 8 countries in Asia: China, Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Part 1 was an online, questionnaire based survey involving 2,467 patients with asthma aged 18-50 years. Part 2 was carried out through face-to-face and online interviews amongst 375 physicians managing asthma patients, 54% of which are specialists (i.e. respiratory medicine, allergy, and clinical immunology) and the rest in primary care practice. Results: A significantly higher proportion of specialists (95%) compared to primary care physicians or PCPs (65%) reported that they use Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) in assessing asthma control. Only 2% of specialists stated that they do not use any guidelines compared to 22% of PCPs. While 89% of patients considered their asthma to be controlled, physicians perceived 53% of their own patients as well-controlled. Both are overestimation of the actual proportion of patients achieving control (18%) based on GINA-defined criteria. Seven out of 10 physicians mentioned that their patients' definition of well-controlled asthma is aligned with their definition. Physicians perceived that patients relate well-controlled asthma to minimal impact on daily life (50%), absence of symptoms (48%), and no/reduced attacks (21%). This is in stark contrast with patients understanding of the concept as they related control more to having medications to cope with their symptoms (26%) or quickly control asthma attacks (15%) reflective of the crisis-oriented mind-set they have towards their disease. Conclusions: Physicians and patients overestimate their level of asthma control. These highlight the importance of accurate assessment in clinical practice, and the role of physicians in improving the understanding of concept of well-controlled asthma amongst their patients. Standardized tools may aid in better assessment of control while using shared language in discussing treatment goals may help ensure physicians' and patients' concept of well-controlled asthma are more aligned."
22915,"XXIV World Allergy Congress 2015: Seoul, Korea. 14-17 October 2015","Methods: MSCs were isolated from human palatine tonsil (T-MSC) and adipose tissues (ASC), and the surface markers were analyzed. The effect of T-MSCs was evaluated in 24 BALB/c mice that were randomly divided into 4 groups (negative control group; positive control group; T-MSC group and ASC group). MSCs were administered intravenously to OVA-sensitized mice (T-MSC and ASC groups) on days 18 to 23 and subsequent OVA challenge was conducted daily from days 24 to 28. Several parameters of allergic inflammation were assessed. Results: T-MSC and ASC had similar characteristics in surface markers. Intravenous injection of T-MSC significantly reduced allergic symptoms, eosinophil infiltration, serum total and OVA specific-IgE and the nasal and systemic Th2 cytokine profile. Further analysis revealed that nasal innate cytokines such as IL-25 and IL-33, and chemokines such as CCL11, CCL24 induction were suppressed in T-MSCs injected groups, explaining their underlying mechanism. Additionally, the T-MSC group had more inhibition of allergic inflammation than the ASC group, which might be attributed to the more proliferative activity of T-MSC. Conclusion: Administration of T-MSC effectively reduced allergic symptoms and inflammatory parameters in the mouse model of AR. T-MSC treatment reduced Th2 cytokines and OVA specific IgE secretion from B cells. In addition, innate cytokine (interleukin-25 and inteleukin-33) expression and eotaxin mRNA expression was inhibited in the nasal mucosa, suggestive of the mechanism of reduced allergic inflammation. Therefore, T-MSC treatment is potentially an alternative therapeutic modality in AR. Objective: Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma are a major global health problem in developed and developing countries like India. These diseases have an adverse impact on the patient's quality of life (QOL) and also pose a big socio-economic burden. Yoga has shown to have some beneficial effect on improving the sleep quality, lung function and quality of life in patients with asthma. But there is no scientific study on the effect of Yoga on airway resistance in patients with AR. The aim of this study was to assess the subjective and objective effects of yoga and also to see if Yoga can be adapted as a cost cutting intervention for better control of asthma and AR. Methods: The present study was conducted on 31 adult subjects with mild-moderate persistent AR with or without asthma. These patients were trained in specific Hatha yogasanas which are known to improve respiratory functions. The participants practised these asanas for 12 weeks. The subjective and objective outcome measures were assessed at baseline (Day 0) and at 12 weeks post yoga, using Rhinomanometry, Spirometry, Sino Nasal Outcome Test questionnaire and QOL Short Form 12. Results: There was a significant reduction in the Total Nasal Resistance (TNR) at 150 Pa/ml/s (p<0.001) and a significant increase in Total Nasal Airflow at 150 Pa/ml/s (p<0.01) after yoga as compared to the corresponding baseline values at day 0. Indices of pulmonary function such as FVC (p<0.001), FEV1 (p<0.05), Forced mid-expiratory flow at 75% of FVC (FEF 75%) (p<0.05) and PEFR (p<0.01) showed significant improvement. QOL questionnaire, Short Form 12 showed a highly significant improvement in both physical (p<0.001) and mental (p<0.01) composite score along with significant reduction in the Sino Nasal Outcome Test score (p<0.001) post yoga as compared to the corresponding baseline values. Conclusions: The direct cost of treatment such as medications and hospital visits etc., as well as the indirect cost due to loss of productivity is significantly high in patients with AR and asthma. The results of this present study conclude that the practice of yoga offers a significant advantage in patients with AR by reducing their nasal resistance, increasing nasal airflow, improving lung functions and their quality of life. Further studies are needed to analyze the immunologcal mechanisms involved in this form of therapy, the impact on acute exacerbations, the need for rescue medication and the long term effects of yoga. A true patient-physician partnership further empowers the patients compliance and adherence, thereby their function and health. Background and Objectives: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin disorder characterized by hives and itching for at least 6 weeks. The QOL in CU can be substantially impaired due to its unpredictable symptoms and long-term nature. This study was aimed to evaluate the impact of CU on QOL by using the CU-specific QOL measurements, previously validated in Korea, and to identify the predictors of QOL in CU patients. Methods: We enrolled 390 adult patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria who were followed in the Allergy and Clinical Immunology Clinic in Ajou university hospital from March 2009 to December 2012. The CU-QOL questionnaires, urticaria activity score (UAS), the presence of angioedema, and serum total IgE levels were investigated. Results: The average CU-QOL scores was 70.6 of 100 points. The CU-QOL scores significantly correlated with the UAS, particularly with our 15-point UAS (UAS15, coefficient -0.532, P <0.01) than the 6-point UAS (-0.502, P<0.01). Total CU-QOL scores significantly decreased in patient with severe CU (UAS15 score≥13) than nonsevere CU (52.3 vs 72.1, P <0.001). In cases having angioedema, the urticaria symptom domain scores significantly decreased (37.4 vs 46.9, P = 0.004) than those with urticaria only. Multivariate analysis showed that severe CU, high log[total IgE], and the presence of angioedema were significant predictors of CU-QOL impairment (<85 points). Conclusions: It is important to consider QOL impairment and severe CU, log[total IgE], and the presence of angioedema are significant CU-QOL predictors in Korean patient with CU. Background: In house dust mite (HDM) allergic asthma, symptoms occur due to airway eosinophilia and Th2 cell activation. Budesonide is used to treat airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness. We showed that dietary non-digestible galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) suppress symptoms in a murine model for HDM-induced asthma. The aim is to study combined dietary GOS and budesonide treatment on allergic asthma in mice. Methods: BALB/c mice were intranasally (i.n.) sensitized with PBS in presence or absence of 1μg HDM and challenged i.n. with PBS or 10μg HDM on days 7 till 11 while being fed a diet containing 0, 1 or 2.5 w/w% GOS. On day 7, 9, 11, and 13 budesonide was either or not instilled oropharyngeally. On day 14, airway resistance to metacholine and inflammation were determined. Leukocyte subtypes were analyzed in the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and in lung cell suspensions. Mucosal mast cell protease-1 (mmcp-1) was measured in serum and cytokines in lung homogenates. Results: HDM-allergy significantly increased airway responsiveness and BAL leukocyte numbers. Budesonide treatment suppressed this, which reached significance in mice fed GOS. Budesonide reduced the number of lymphocytes and eosinophils in the BAL. Feeding GOS in absence of budesonide treatment reduced the number of eosinophils as well. In addition, both GOS as well as budesonide reduced mmcp-1 serum concentrations. Interestingly, only in the GOS fed mice, budesonide treatment reduced IL-33 and IL-13 concentrations and the frequency of Th2 cells in the lung. Conclusions: Dietary intervention using GOS may be a novel way to improve effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drug therapy in asthma. This study was performed within the framework of Carbohydrate Competence Center (WP25)."
22915,"XXIV World Allergy Congress 2015: Seoul, Korea. 14-17 October 2015","Food and drug allergies are common causes of anaphylaxis. Shellfish is the most common food allergen. Anaphylaxis caused by drugs, stinging insects and shellfish was more common in adults, whilst anaphylaxis caused by peanuts and tree nuts is more common with children. Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease characterized by dry skin with severe itching. Children with AD and their caregivers report disease associated sleep disruption, irritability, anxiety, behavior problems. Moreover, AD places a significant economic burden on the patient, family and society. So, an integrated health care service can be useful to comprehensively evaluate triggers and response to treatment, address confounding factors including psychological problems, and educate patients and family. Method: This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated health care service in children with AD according to quality of life and clinical symptom scores. 134 children were referred from local health care office to Seoul Medical Center for management of AD from July to December, 2011. The questionnaire developed by the 'Atopy Free Seoul' research project in 2008 was used for quality of life (QOL) survey, and SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) was done at each visit. Results: The study targets were 134 children with the average age of 6.11 years with AD and visited the hospital 2.01 times on average. It was found that the QOL scores of patients participated in our integrated health care service was reduced by 10.43 after treatment compared before intervention (p<0.0001). In 46 children among them, SCORAD also averagely decreased by 5.78 after treatment (p<0.0001). Moreover there is positive correlation between changes in scores of QOL and SCORAD of 46 patients (r=0.46, P<0.001). 74.6% was satisfied with improvement degree of symptoms after integrated health care service and 70.1% was satisfied with improvement degree of daily life. Conclusion: Integrated health care service for children with AD improved disease severity and quality of life. The results from our multidisciplinary approach supported the need for and feasibility of integrated care for children with AD and their families. Backgrounds: A substantial proportion of patients with chronic urticaria (CU) is refractory to antihistamines. It remains unknown how we identify a subpopulation whose urticaria is not completely controlled by antihistamines. Autologous serum skin test (ASST) response has been suggested as a potential predictor of urticaria control. We sought to identify proteins that were differentially expressed in the sera between patients with positive and negative ASST. Method: The proteomic analysis was performed using sera from 3 patients with positive results on ASST compared with those with negative ASST. Seven upregulated and 5 down-regulated proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-offlight mass spectrometry in the positive ASST group compared with the negative ASST group. Results: Proteins differentially expressed according to the ASST results in CU patients were classified into 5 groups: apolipoproteins, glycoproteins, modified albumin, haptoglobulin, and plectin. Among them, apolipoprotein J or clusterin was validated by using ELISA. Clusterin levels in 69 ASST positive patients were significantly higher than those in 69 ASST negative patients and in 86 healthy controls (median 227.6, min-max 108. 5-359.9 vs 209.4, 117.3-288 .0 vs 133.2, 0.06-277.6 μg/ml, P <0.001). Furthermore, it differs significantly between patients with well responsive and refractory to antihistamine treatment within 3 months (227. 6, 117.3-359.9 vs 197.5, 108.5-309 .8 μg/ml, P = 0.002). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis yielded 202 ug/ml of serum clusterin as the optimal cut-off for discriminating the responsiveness to antihistamines in CSU patients (AUC 0.759, 95% CI 0.679-0.839, P < 0.001). Criteria combining ASST results and serum clusterin levels can predict 92.7% of CU patients whose urticaria would be refractory to antihistamines. Conclusion: Considering on that clusterin is able to modulate complement function, we suggest that serum clusterin can be a prognostic marker to determine the responsiveness to antihistamine treatment in patients with CU. This work was supported by grants from National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Korean Government (MSIP: NRF-2012R1A5A2048183). Several biomarkers have been developed to address airway inflammation in bronchial asthma (BA), including exhaled nitric oxide, sputum eosinophils. However it is challenging and sometimes considered to be rather invasive to appropriately obtain those biomarkers in young children. Since urine is a non-invasive and easy-toobtain samples in children, urinary leukotriene E4 (uLTE4) is one of the most potent biomarkers to address airway inflammation in infants. To ask whether uLTE4 can be used for the diagnosis of BA in young children, we determined concentrations of uLTE4 of wheezing children. A total of 184 patients at an outpatient clinic in Saitama prefecture in Japan for wheezing from February 2012 to August 2013 participated in the study. Urine samples were collected and immediately frozen until use. LTE4 was collected with an anti-LTE4 antibody and the concentrations were determined by ELISA. Urine creatinine (uCr) levels were also determined. Since uCr levels differ among different ages, we first corrected all the uCr values with those at corresponding ages. uLTE4 was then normalized to age-corrected uCr levels. Patients consisted of the first wheezers with or without a family history of BA, the first wheezers with RSV infection, intermittent BA, mild persistent BA and controls with fever but not wheezing. uLTE4 levels of the first wheezers with a family history who responded to inhalation of bronchodilator (n=33) and intermittent BA (n=25) were higher (p<0.01) than those of controls. There were no significant differences between uLTE4 in other groups and controls. These results suggest that uLTE4 can be a marker of allergic airway inflammation in young children. We are currently following clinical courses of those patients to ask whether uLTE4 can be a predictive marker for the development of BA. Background: Orally ingested food proteins normally result in the induction of oral tolerance, whereas allergic sensitization to food proteins in mice is induced in the presence of a mucosal adjuvant like cholera toxin (CT). CT is therefore often used as a tool to unravel the mechanisms behind allergic sensitization, although CT is not involved in the onset of allergic sensitization in humans. The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) is among the most frequently detected contaminants of wheat and wheat-based products, and is able to impair intestinal barrier function. As such, we hypothesize that DON may represent a more human-relevant mucosal adjuvant and therefore the present study investigated the capacity of DON to act as a mucosal adjuvant in a mouse model of whey-induced food allergy. Methods: Female C3H/HeOuJ mice (n=8 per group) were orally exposed to DON plus whey once a week for 5 weeks, while control mice received DON in PBS. Acute allergic skin responses, change in body temperature and other anaphylactic shock reactions were measured upon whey-challenge. Allergen-specific antibodies and ST2 were measured in serum. mRNA expression of claudin-2 and -3, Ecadherin and IL-33 were determined in intestinal tissue and ST2 was measured in serum 6h after a single oral DON-exposure. Results: Mice exposed to DON plus whey showed whey-specific IgG1, IgG2a and IgE antibodies in serum and an acute allergic skin response upon intradermal whey challenge compared to control mice. Furthermore, a significant time-dependent increase in soluble ST2 in serum was observed in DON plus whey sensitized mice compared to control mice. In addition, analysis of intestinal tissues, isolated 6h after a single oral exposure to DON, revealed increased mRNA expression of the tight junction proteins claudin-2 and -3 and the adherens junction E-cadherin, as well as an increase in IL-33 mRNA accompanied by an increase in the soluble IL-33 receptor ST2 in serum."
22915,"XXIV World Allergy Congress 2015: Seoul, Korea. 14-17 October 2015","Conclusions: Together, these results demonstrate that DON facilitates allergic sensitization and may thus serve as a model adjuvant. Our data therefore illustrate the possible contribution of food contaminants, like DON, in allergic sensitization in humans. Background: Lately, the evidence shows a huge epidemiological burden of chronic cough in general populations. However, the definitions of chronic cough varied, and no definitions were validated for clinical relevance. We examined existing epidemiological definitions in detail and investigated the operational characteristics. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted for the epidemiological studies that reported the prevalence of chronic cough in general adult populations, which were published in the peerreviewed journals during the years 1980 to 2013. The operational characteristics of the most common definition were examined by meta-analyses of the male-to-female ratio in chronic cough prevalence. Results: The systematic review included 70 studies. The most common definition was cough ≥ 3 months (12-month prevalence) without specification of phlegm (n=50), which conflicts with the criteria in clinical guidelines of cough ≥ 8 weeks. Meta-analyses were conducted for the male-to-female ratio of chronic cough among 28 studies that reported sex-specific prevalence using the most common definition; however, the pooled maleto-female odds ratio was 1.26 (95% confidence interval 0.92-1.73) with significant heterogeneity (I 2 =96%, P<0.001), which was in contrast to previous clinical observations of female predominance in cough clinics. Conclusions: This study indicates two important issues in defining chronic cough in further epidemiological studies. A conflict between epidemiological and clinical definitions in duration criteria needs to be resolved. Another unexpected difference in the gender preponderance between the community and clinics warrants clinical validation of the existing definition. Background: The objective of this study is to investigate the physicians' approach to asthmatic or COPD patients, living in different areas of Turkey. In this report baseline demographics, risk factors, and adherence to therapy of asthmatic and COPD patients are compared. Methods: A total of 1892 newly diagnosed adult patients (1116 asthmatic, 776 COPD) from 136 secondary or tertiary centers of different geographic locations took part in this study, and a standard webbased questionnaire including items related with demographic, clinical, laboratory and pharmacological parameters was applied from July 2012 to May 2014. Results: Asthmatic patients were mostly female (64.4%), while the male patients were higher (88.1%) in COPD. The percentage of patients whose age is ≥65 years was significantly higher in COPD patients compared to asthmatic patients (30.4% and 7.1%, respectively) (p<0.001). Evaluation of the disease severity showed that nearly half of the asthmatic patients were in ""moderate persistent"" category (45.0%) and more than half of the COPD patients (54.4%) were in ""GOLD B"". More than half of both asthmatic and COPD patients had at least one accompanying disease (53.9% and 52.8%, respectively) and hypertension was the most seen disease in both asthmatic and COPD patients (13.9% and 21.1%, respectively) (p<0.0001). Nearly half of the asthmatic patients (45.5%) stated asthma and 13.7% stated COPD in their family history, while nearly ¼ of COPD patients stated COPD (22.2%) and 8.2% stated asthma. Evaluation of smoking anamnesis showed that there was a significant difference between asthmatic and COPD patients by means of ""currently smoking"" status; percentages were 27.9% and 56.3%, respectively (p<0.001). It is found that the percentage of COPD patients (37.0%) who have been exposed to dust, gas and/or vapor in work place was significantly higher than asthmatic patients (25.2%) (p<0.001). Evaluation of trigger factors showed that air pollution was the most common trigger in both asthma (54.1%) and COPD (54.6%) groups. Evaluation of adherence to the study visits showed that percentage of the patients coming to one control visit was higher in asthmatics compared to COPD patients (61.6% and 55.9%, respectively) (p=0.014). However, when groups were compared in terms of 3rd follow-up visit, adherence was low in both groups (20.3% and 18.7% for asthma and COPD). Compliance to the treatment in percentages of regular medication use was significantly better in COPD patients compared to asthmatic patients (p=0.021). Conclusion: COPD and asthma are associated with significant economic burden. Identification and reduction of exposure to risk factors are important in the treatment and prevention. Patient compliance may be the key to better disease management. We need new strategies to improve adherence in patients."
22915,"XXIV World Allergy Congress 2015: Seoul, Korea. 14-17 October 2015","Conclusions: This study revealed that ocular symptoms of Japanese cedar pollinosis are prevalent even in years with low cedar pollen dispersal, and that pollinosis patients with ocular symptoms were likely to have more severe nasal symptoms. Background: Adverse drug reaction (ADR) increases in-hospital stay, cost of care, and even mortality. Prevention of ADRs leads to marked socioeconomic benefits. We performed this study to investigate the incidence, actual reporting status and clinical features of ADRs, for improving ADR reporting system and preventing recurrent ADRs. Methods: A retrospective study was performed in a regional university hospital located in Jeju, Korea. ADR cases were recruited by review of medical records from 2009 to 2013. An ADR event was defined as either of ADR-related diagnosis in a patient or ADRs reported through in-hospital ADR reporting system. The incidence, culprit drug, clinical manifestation, source of reporting, severity, treatment, and recurrence rate were assessed. Results: In 1112 patients, 1375 ADR events were enrolled, estimated as 0.06% of total patient-visit during the study period. Diagnostic contrast agent (46.4%) was most common as culprit drugs, followed by antibiotics (22%), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (9.9%), and opioids (4.5%). Cutaneous involvement (67.5%) such as rash and hives was the most frequently observed manifestation. In two thirds of ADR cases, additional medical attentions were noted. In severity, 180 (13.1%) were categorized in severe ADRs. Nineteen (1.4%) experienced re-exposure to the culprit drugs, resulting recurrent ADR and 4 (0.3%) died of ADRs. Physicians were the most frequent ADR reporter using in-hospital ADR reporting system. Conclusions: Large proportions of ADR events might be omitted in medical records or in reporting system. ADRs due to re-exposure to the culprit drugs were not rare. To prevent avoidable ADRs, an effective reporting and alerting system is necessary. Background: To analyze related risk factors and features of food allergy in Korea children through a cross sectional survey. Methods: We used a stratified cluster sampling design and chosen from a random sample of 45 primary and 40 middle schools in South Korea between October and November 2010. Total 7,725 children aged 6-7 years and 13-14 years were involved. We acquired that the information of food allergy from the questionnaires and analyzed the mean value of continuous variable (Total Ig E and Eosinophil count) and the risk factors which were associated with food allergy using multivariate logistic regression."

In univariated analysis, maternal depressions was associated with single mother, low economic state, maternal asthma, atopic dermatitis, children's asthma. (p<0.05) but sex, age, education status and smoking were not associated with the presence of maternal depression. After adjustment, maternal depression were associated with lower house income, maternal asthma, maternal atopic dermatitis, children's asthma."
22915,"XXIV World Allergy Congress 2015: Seoul, Korea. 14-17 October 2015","Conclusion: IL-23 may play a significant role in allergic asthma during allergen sensitization period. Particularly, it may be significantly involved in allergen-contacted epithelial cell responses finally leading to allergic sensitization. Background: High prevalence rates of asthma and allergic rhinitis have recently been shown in South Korea. For better prevention of development or exacerbation of both allergic diseases, the secondary prevention from symptoms of atopic dermatitis (AD) could be effective, in the aspect of ""allergic march"". For this reason, we aimed to explore how the variation of indoor risk factors may be linked with the change of symptoms of AD or development of asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. Methods: We recruited homes of AD patients aged with around 24 months old, along with SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Index of greater than 25 through the both Environmental Health Centers for Asthma and Atopic allergy. Total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), formaldehyde (HCHO), airborne mold and bacteria, and particulate matter with diameter less than 10 mm (PM 10 ) were measured in their dwellings in both indoor and outdoor. Particularly, the levels of TVOC and PM 10 were monitored for 24 hrs using direct reading instruments as well. Results: Both environmental surveys were performed in a total of 51 houses. The mean age (± standard deviation, SD) and SCORAD Index of subjects was 2.2 ± 0.2 years old and 39.5±18.3, respectively. The geometric mean (GM) concentrations of airborne mold were 526.6-565.5 CFU/m 3 , which refer to above the recommended level of WHO. However, the corresponding value of airborne bacteria were below the Korean standard guideline (800 CFU/m 3 ). For exposure level of gaseous pollutants in indoor, TVOC and HCHO ranged from 566.6-748.3 μg/m 3 and 31.0-35.9 μg/m 3 , respectively, but the outdoor levels were 382.4-453.1 μg/m 3 ; for TVOC and 4.0-4.6 μg/m 3 for HCHO. The highest levels of TVOC and PM 10 monitored using each direct reading instrument were observed after midnight and in the evening, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that a comparable amount of bioaerosols and gaseous pollutants in indoor were observed in patient's dwellings. Particularly, different exposure patterns for particulate matter and TOVC were shown time -dependently, and so a proper prevention strategy should be prepared. Background: Peripheral blood eosinophilia is a common clinical manifestation which draws medical attention. However there are little reports on blood eosinophilia in the elderly. We aimed to investigate the normal ranges of blood eosinophils and associated factors including allergic parameters, using the dataset of a communitybased random elderly population in Korea. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was performed using the database of Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging, a community-based elderly cohort. The primary outcome was peripheral blood eosinophil counts and the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for absolute count of blood eosinophil counts was calculated for normal ranges. Demographic, socioeconomic, metabolic, comorbidities, allergic parameters, and lung function were analyzed. Atopy was defined with skin test by positive to any of 12 common inhalant allergens. Allergic history and symptoms were assessed by questionnaires. Results: Cutoff value for blood eosinophilia was less than 406.6x10 3 / mL (n=1,000). The prevalence of eosinophilia (>500x10 3 /mL) and hypereosinophilia (>1,500x10 3 /mL) were 4.12% and 0.20%, respectively. In univariate analyses, blood eosinophil counts was significantly related to male sex, and smoking status. However, in multivariate analyses, the association of blood eosinophil count with male sex appeared to be at least partly dependent on smoking status. Other potential determinants (P<0.10 in univariate analyses) were body mass index, atopy, current wheeze, and physician-diagnosed asthma. In multivariate linear regression analyses, the relationships between blood eosinophil counts and potential determinant factors were examined. Conclusion: The normal range of peripheral blood eosinophils in the Korean elderly was ≤ 406.6 x10 3 /mL (upper 95th percentile), which was almost identical to the reference range in the literature. Smoking was a major determinant factor for eosinophilia, and explained the association of eosinophilia with male sex. Other determinant factors were body mass index, atopy, and asthma. These findings could suggest a potential role of blood eosinophils as an epidemiologic marker for atopy and asthma in the elderly population. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is severe acute mucocutanous bullous disorders that are most commonly drug-induced. Antibiotics are the most common cause of SJS, followed by analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticonvulsants, and antigout drugs. Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist, has been used in the treatment of psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and neoplastic disease including leukemia and lymphoma. Its principal toxic effects are bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal mucositis, hepatitis, renal impairment, and erythematous rashes. SJS has been reported in a few patients receiving intermediate or high dose methotrexate. Whether the epidermal necrolysis is an allergic or dose-related toxicity reaction is still controversial. We report a case of SJS in a patient receiving low dose methotrexate for psoriasis. A 67-year-old male presented with a generalized erythematous rash and erosion, and severe oral ulcers. He had started allopurinol and well tolerated for 1 year. The patient had a history of low-dose methotrexate treatment (5 mg/day) 6 days before the development of his complaints. On the second day after methotrexate treatment, erythematous itchy and edematous rash developed on his legs, which spread widely on his trunk and extremities with subsequent bullous formation. He suffered from aggravation of oropharyngeal ulcer. He was admitted to a local hospital and treated with systemic corticosteroids for 5 days. Skin lesions improved, but he was transferred to our hospital for persistent painful ulcer and odynophagia. He was treated with topical steroid for skin lesion and total parenteral nutrition had been started because he had difficulty in eating. He recovered gradually and was discharged with supportive therapy but without additional systemic corticosteroid."
22915,"XXIV World Allergy Congress 2015: Seoul, Korea. 14-17 October 2015","Results: The sensitization rate of potassium dichromate was 5.9% (n=58) and women comprised 72.4% (n=42) of chromium (+) group. Hands and feet were more frequently affected in chromium (+) group (P=0.002, 0.019). Occupational dermatitis was not significantly more common in chromium (+) group. Chromium allergy was most prevalent in patients in their 50s (8.4%). The prevalence of chromium allergy was 13.5% during 1998-2002 but decreased to 5.4% during 2010-2014. Conclusion: The characteristics of patients with chromium allergy suggested that chromium exposure in daily activities, including leather exopsure, is more relevant than occupational exposure in most patients. The prevalence of chromium allergy has been decreased in Korea, which may be an effect of voluntary regulation of chromium extent in cement by manufacturers A) Background: Chronic hand eczema (CHE) may severely reduce patient's quality of life. CHE refractory to topical corticosteroids currently have limited treatment options suited for chronic use. In demand of safe new therapy, oral alitretinoin, 9-cisretinoic acid, was proposed, but the economic burden limits its broad use. Acitretin is a well-known second generation vitamin A derivative, widely used in palmoplantar psoriasis with less cost. The investigation was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of acitretin in chronic hand eczema patients. B) Methods: Total of 25 patients diagnosed with CHE were enrolled in the prospective open-label study. All patients were administered with oral acitretin, start dose of 10mg twice daily and tapered to 10mg once daily, during 8 week period. CHE severity was evaluated using a hand eczema severity index and 5-grade physicial global assessment (PGA). C) Results: Severity of hand eczema decreased by 58% in average. The improvement was more remarkable in hyperkeratotic type than other types of hand eczema (p<0.004). Clinical responses, defined as clear or almost clear, were achieved in up to 36% of patients. No serious side effects were reported except of mild cheilitis in 2 patients and abdominal discomfort in 1 patients. D) Conclusion: Oral acitretin is well-tolerated with effectively improving chronic hand eczema, especially in hyperkeratotic type."

Prevalence ranges from 11.7% to 21.2% in adults in Turkey. AR leads to substantial socioeconomic costs and loss in quality of life. It typically begins in childhood or adolescence. Hereditary factors and gender plays an important role in the development. The prevalence of self-reported and physician-diagnosed AR exhibits significant variability across the seven geographical regions in Turkey. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of AR in the Turkish adult population. METHODS An epidemiological study was planned among the students of Celal Bayar University from various regions of Turkey to find the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and search for geographical differences in Turkey. A questionnaire was designed to collect data on sociodemographic features, symptoms of allergic rhinitis, and any prior diagnosis of allergic rhinitis made by a physician."
22940,Bovine coronavirus in naturally and experimentally exposed calves; viral shedding and the potential for transmission,"Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an important livestock pathogen with a high prevalence worldwide. The virus causes respiratory disease and diarrhea in calves and winter dysentery in adult cattle. These diseases result in substantial economic losses and reduced animal welfare [1] . One way of reducing the negative consequences of this virus is to prevent virus transmission between herds. Inter-herd transmission is possible either directly via transfer of live animals [2, 3] , or indirectly via contaminated personnel or equipment [4] . Measures to prevent virus spread between herds must be based upon knowledge of viral shedding, the potential for transmission to susceptible animals and the role of protective immunity. Several observational studies have been published on BCoV shedding in feces of diarrheic calves and after transportation to feedlots [3, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, relatively few studies on BCoV pathogenesis with emphasis on transmission potential under controlled conditions have been published."
22940,Bovine coronavirus in naturally and experimentally exposed calves; viral shedding and the potential for transmission,"In the present study, the virus that caused winter dysentery in adult cattle primarily gave respiratory disease in calves. Niskanen et al. also found that BCoV derived from an outbreak of winter dysentery caused mainly respiratory disease in weaned calves [29] , supporting that BCoV is an important cause of respiratory disease in calves [42, 43] and winter dysentery in adults [17] . The economic and welfare consequences of BCoV therefore include the combined effects of neonatal enteritis, respiratory disease in young cattle and winter dysentery in adults. Also considering the high prevalence worldwide, BCoV is an important loss-inflicting factor in the cattle industry."
23719,"Prevalence of avian infectious bronchitis virus in broiler chicken farms in south of Iraq, 2014 – 2015","Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious viral disease of the upper respiratory and urogenital tract of chickens, which is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The disease is prevalent in all countries with an intensive poultry industry, affecting the performance of both broilers and layers, thereby causing the considerable economic loss in poultry industry worldwide. 1 The virus is the coronavirus of the domestic fowl that is mainly observed in chicken. It possesses a positive sense singlestranded RNA genome that ranges from 27 to 31 Kb. 2 The number of IBV serotypes that exist throughout the world is unknown. More than 50 different serotypes have been listed and new IBV variants continue to emerge. 3 It is now well documented that a considerable number of different serotypes with antigenic and pathogenic differences exist in poultry industry of different parts of the world. 4 The D274 type was the most common type of IBV in several western European countries in the early and mid-1980s. 5 IBV strains of the 4/91 type, which are also known as 793B, were first reported and characterized in Britain, 1991, 6 and have been the dominant genotype in Europe. 7 The Serological survey has revealed a high incidence of IBV infection of the 793/B type in layer and broiler chickens worldwide. 8 Infectious bronchitis still causes serious problems in the Iraqi poultry industry due to the inability of the vaccines to protect the different genotypes. Due to the limited network of poultry diagnostic laboratories in Iraq, differential diagnosis is only made according to clinical signs and gross lesions."
23719,"Prevalence of avian infectious bronchitis virus in broiler chicken farms in south of Iraq, 2014 – 2015","Infectious bronchitis (IB) has a significant economic impact on the poultry industry causing the loss of millions of dollars worldwide each year due to the condemnation of infected chickens. 13 Since it was first described in the early nineties in the United Kingdom, 4/91 type IBVs was identified in many other countries and became one of the most predominant genotype in Europe. 14, 15 Recombination with field isolates and reversion to virulence has been reported for the IBV vaccines. 16, 17 Therefore, it is important to verify the relationship between field isolates and the vaccine strain. 18 Despite the availability of an attenuated vaccine against 793/B serotype viruses, recent studies suggest that viruses belonging to the 793/B serogroup are still prevalent in European flocks, and their continual presence is still an important concern for the poultry industries in many different countries. 19 It is now recognized that IBV comprises more than one serotype. The original serotype Mass has now been spread worldwide and is included in most of the commercially available vaccines. 20 The results of the present study showed that 34 (74.00%) out of 46 sampled flocks were positive to IBV by real-time PCR and that 35.00%, 35.00% and 30.00% of the sampled flock in Basra, Thi-Qar and Muthana, respectively, governorates were positive to IBV. In addition, the results showed the distribution of 793/B and Mass genotypes with the prevalence rate of 50.00% and 5.89%, respectively, yet no D274-type virus was detected in the south of Iraq. The presence of other IBV types is probable, however, they were not detectable as applied primers were specifically amplified three types of IBV. Unknown positive IBV strains must be sequenced to be characterized."
23999,Porcine epidemic diarrhoea: new insights into an old disease,"There is no specific treatment for PEDV other than supportive care and symptomatic treatment. Mortality occurs in suckling piglets as a result of dehydration which should be corrected using oral electrolyte solutions. In adult pigs, dry feed should be withdrawn for a period of 12-24 h and then, carefully reintroduced while water should be kept freely available [3, 4] . In order to increase passive immunity to piglets and minimize losses, sows due to farrow in at least 2 weeks can be deliberately exposed to virulent virus by the oral route. A recent study revealed that morbidity was reduced from 100 to 43 % in litters exposed to virulent PEDV when their sows were previously exposed to a mild virulent strain (S INDEL variant) of PEDV [63] . Oral administration of chicken egg-yolk or cow colostrum containing PEDV immunoglobulins could offer an immunoprophilactic defence [64, 65] . The increase in lactogenic immunity is also the aim of PEDV vaccines which are used in pregnant sows. Attenuated or killed vaccines against PEDV have been used in several Asian countries for years [66] . However, it has been suggested that live vaccines can revert to virulence and their use and usefulness under field conditions have been questioned [5, 27, 67] . Recently, a PEDV subunit vaccine based on the S protein gene of PEDV as well as a vaccine with killed virus have been licensed in the USA [68] , although there are still no studies which prove their efficacy. However, PEDV vaccines have never been used in Europe as the disease was not of sufficient economic importance in this area. In general, PEDV vaccines have been reported to be useful to booster antibody response in animals that have already been infected by PEDV."
24041,Cross-sectional survey of selected enteric viruses in Polish turkey flocks between 2008 and 2011,"Enteric diseases are an important health problem for the intensive poultry industry and can result in considerable economic losses. The most characteristic of these conditions are diarrhea, stunting, huddling, increased feed conversion and extended time-to-market. In the more severe forms, immune dysfunction and increased mortality may occur. Different terms have been used to describe enteric disease syndrome in turkey: poult enteritis complex (PEC) and poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) or light turkey syndrome (LTS) [1] [2] [3] . However, none of these descriptions relate to any specific agents, and numerous factors have been associated with them, including environmental, such as housing, ventilation, temperature and humidity; management, such as biosecurity programmes; and microbiological agents (viruses, bacteria and parasites). In recent years there has been a lot of research regarding the viral origin of enteric diseases, and different viruses, such as astrovirus, coronavirus, reovirus, rotavirus, parvovirus, and adenovirus have been identified in intestinal tract of not only diseased but also healthy poultry. The role of some viruses in enteritis is well-defined, i.e. coronavirus is a known factor of mud fever/bluecomb disease of turkeys [4] . However, the clinical and epidemiological significance of turkey infection with most of them still remains unclear. It seems that viruses are present in large amounts and different combinations in bird intestines, but in optimal nutritional and environmental conditions they do not cause clinical disease. In favorable conditions, such as feed change, sudden temperature shift or other stress factors, the viruses present in the gut might damage its walls making birds more susceptible to secondary bacterial infection. Furthermore, it is also possible that enteric viruses could contribute to the development of symptoms only by co-infections with multiple viruses. For a better understanding and control of enteric disease in turkeys, more studies on enteric viruses are needed."

In addition, some IBV strains affect the renal tubuli, oviduct and parts of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to pathological lesions in these organ systems, with subsequent reduced weight gain and a drop in egg production. The virus has a worldwide presence in both commercial and backyard chickens, appearing in a wide variety of geno-, sero-and protectotypes [2] .

24327,"36th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine: Brussels, Belgium. 15-18 March 2016","(1) The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and nature of patient-reported alopecia in a cohort of critical illness survivors. Methods: This was a single centre, qualitative survey study completed in the ICU Follow-up Clinic of a teaching hospital in Wales. All patients who had been discharged home for at least 12 weeks, following an ICU stay of three or more days and attending the Follow-Up Clinic, were invited to complete the survey. The survey was adapted from one used in a previous study and included questions regarding patient demographics and alopecia.(2) Statistical analysis included numbers (%) and medians (IQR). Comparisons between patients with and without alopecia were made using Fisher's Exact test and Mann Whitney U test. Due to the anonymity of the surveys the Wales REC 6 confirmed ethical approval was not needed for this study. Results: The survey was completed by 75 patients attending the clinic between July and December 2014. Median age was 65 years and 35 % of patients were male. Alopecia was reported in 13 (17 %) patients and the hair loss was gradual in 12 (92 %) of the 13 patients. The severity of hair loss in this cohort ranged between less than 10 % to over 50 %, with the location of hair loss varying between the patients. In all but one of the patients hair loss occurred gradually at between one and six weeks post-ICU discharge and lasted for between one and seven months. On analysis, no significant differences were found between the patients with and without alopecia in the demographic variables. Conclusions: Limited research exists examining the incidence and nature of patient-reported alopecia in adult survivors of critical illness. The type, amount and location of the hair loss varied between patients in this study. The main limitation of this study is the survey design resulting in a lack of information regarding potential predictors of alopecia. The incidence reported in this study however suggests that further research is warranted. Introduction: South Wales is an area of relative socio-economic deprivation, with a myriad of well-recognised associated mental health problems. Patients with mental health disorders are commonly admitted to an ICU as a direct consequence of their illness, such as a suicide attempt, or due to indirect consequences, such as an intravenous drug overdose in drug addicts. As a result of these findings we set out to ascertain the effect of pre-existing mental health issues including addiction on ICU admission. Methods: A prospective study design was used in which data was collected on all admissions to the general ICU of a large teaching hospital in South Wales, over a two month period. All adult patients were screened for the following questions; Was the admission a direct consequence of a mental health disorder or recreational/ illicit psychoactive substance use? Is there a co-existing mental health diagnosis present prior to admission? ICD-10 codes were used to define mental health disorders. Outcomes studied included in-hospital mortality, ventilator days and length of ICU stay. Data analysis included Fisher Exact and Mann Whitney U tests. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Ethical approval was waived for this service evaluation."
24327,"36th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine: Brussels, Belgium. 15-18 March 2016","Results: In 2014, 1075 patients were admitted to our MICU, 244 aged 80 or more, oldest being 98. ICU mortality among octagenerians was 28 % and was significantly higher compared to the younger patients (19 % mortality; p <0.0005). None of the patients aged 80 or more diagnosed with sepsis survived ICU. In-hospital mortality of octagenerians was 43 %. 10 patients (4 %) were readmitted to ICU, none of whom survived. Pre-admission performance status was not predictive considering ICU or hospital mortality. Conclusions: Octagenerians have higher ICU mortality rates compared to younger patients and their in-hospital mortality doubles. Readmission to ICU in analyzed period was associated with 100 % mortality. Pre ICU performance status was independent risk factor for mortality. Careful evaluation is warranted before readmitting elderly patient to MICU. We encourage making clear therapeutic plan after ICU discharge with clear recommendations considering potential ICU readmission, re-introducing invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, vasopressor or commencing renal replacement therapy and antibiotic treatment. Introduction: Many elderly patients are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) despite known poor outcomes and frequent patient preference to avoid unnecessary prolongation of life. The REALISTIC-80 (Realities, Expectations and Attitudes to LIfe Support Technologies in Intensive Care for Octogenarians) trial studied the outcomes of very elderly patients admitted to ICUs in Canada. Not only was mortality high, but long-term physical and functional recovery was also poor, raising questions about the appropriateness of ICU admission in this group. These findings also carry significant economic implications. Using data from REALISTIC-80 trial, we examined the cost of ICU admission for the very elderly, factors affecting this cost, and the potential savings of reducing admissions that are either undesired by the patient or medically futile."
24327,"36th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine: Brussels, Belgium. 15-18 March 2016","Methods: This multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study included patients > =80 years old admitted to 22 Canadian ICUs from 2009-2013. Overall cost of care per patient was determined by length of stay and direct-variable costs for ICU admission. Using both univariate and logistic regression models, we investigated potentially predictive factors influencing cost, including patient outcome (death vs. survival), frailty, residence in a nursing home, as well as the presence of advance directives. An exploratory analysis was performed to illustrate the potential cost savings of reducing the number of ICU admissions in this population. Results: In total, 3,064 patients > =80 years old were admitted to ICU, of which 1,917 were eligible, and 610 were enrolled in the study. The average age was 84 years; median length of stay was 5 days in ICU and 21 days in hospital. Mortality was 14% in ICU, 26% in hospital and 41% at 12 months. For non-survivors, the median time from admission to death was 12 days. Of enrolled patients, 240 (39%) remained in ICU for 7 days or more; 99 (41%) of these died in hospital. At 1 year, 28% of patients had meaningful recovery measured by the Short Form-36, a survey of general health status that includes both physical and mental health component scales. The results of the cost analysis are pending and will be presented at the conference. Conclusions: In this study, we will demonstrate the significant economic costs of critical care in very elderly patients admitted to ICU-a population for whom this level of care is often unwanted or futile. More importantly, we expect to illustrate the potential cost savings of reducing these admissions, which will be crucial for informing clinical and policymaking decisions."
24481,Cellular RNA Helicase DDX1 Is Involved in Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus nsp14-Induced Interferon-Beta Production,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an enteropathogenic coronavirus (CoV) of porcine, causes lethal watery diarrhea and severe dehydration in piglets and leads to severe economic losses in the swine industry. Unlike most CoVs that antagonize type I interferon (IFN) production, previous studies showed that TGEV infection induces IFN-I production both in vivo and in vitro. However, the underlying mechanism(s) remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that TGEV infection significantly facilitated IFN-β production as well as activation of the transcription factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. Screening of TGEV-encoded proteins demonstrated that non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) was the most potent IFN-β inducer and induced IFN-β production mainly by activating NF-κB but not IRF3. Further analysis showed that nsp14 interacted with DDX1, a member of the DExD/H helicase family. Knockdown of DDX1 by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly decreased nsp14-induced IFN-β production and NF-κB activation. Furthermore, TGEV-induced IFN-β production and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression were decreased in cells transfected with DDX1-specific siRNA, indicating the vital role of DDX1 to TGEV-induced IFN-β responses. In summary, our data revealed a potential coactivator role of host RNA helicase DDX1 to the induction of IFN-β response initiated by TGEV and demonstrated that nsp14 is an important IFN inducer among the TGEVencoded proteins."

24623,A simple and rapid identification method for newly emerged porcine Deltacoronavirus with loop-mediated isothermal amplification,"PDCoV was first described as a newly emerged coronavirus in swine from rectal swabs in 2012 by Woo [2] . Since then, PDCoV infections have been reported in America, Europe, and Asia, and caused substantial economic losses [4-7, 18, 19] . As a result, it is urgently needed to develop an easy, rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic method for In this study, a RT-LAMP assay was developed and evaluated for PDCoV detection. A set of primers was designed against the conserved coding regions of the N gene of PDCoV and the reaction conditions were optimized. The RT-LAMP assay was able to detect PDCoV with a detection limit of 10 copies, which was 100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR. Furthermore, the RT-LAMP assay only needs a water bath for 70 min incubation to accomplish efficient amplification, which was much fast and simple when compared with conventional RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR."
24876,Trypsin-independent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus US strain with altered virus entry mechanism,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that can cause diarrhea and vomiting in the affected pigs with high mortality of up to 100% in neonatal piglets. Since the first report of PEDV case in the UK in 1971 [1] , PEDV has spread throughout the EU during the 1970s and 1980s [2, 3] . While PEDV strains are classified into two distinct genogroups (1 and 2) and subgroups within the genogroups (a and b) [4, 5] , recent reports suggest more than 2 genogroups may exist in the field [6] . In the last 30 years or so, PEDV genogroup 1 (and more recently genogroup 2) caused outbreaks with extensive economic losses in some Asian countries with up to 80% to 100% morbidity and 50% to 90% fatality in suckling piglets [7] [8] [9] . In the US, the first PEDV outbreaks occurred in 2013 [10] . Since then the US PEDV strains that belong to subgroup 2a have quickly spread to the most states as well as Canada and Mexico [4, [11] [12] [13] . The US PEDV strains were also reported to have caused outbreaks in Asian and European countries [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , raising significant economic and public health concerns worldwide [24, 25] . Modified live attenuated vaccines (MLVs) for PEDV genogroup 1 are available in Asian countries, and they have been the major means to control PEDV [26] [27] [28] [29] . However, the genogroup 1 MLVs may not provide effective protective immunity to the circulating subgroup 2a PEDV strains due to the genetic diversity of about 10% in the S1 gene between the genogroups [4, 11, 30] . Currently two conditionally approved vaccines exist in the US: alphavirusbased vaccine (Harrisvacccines) and an inactivated vaccine (Zoetis) [31] . However, MLVs are not yet available for US PEDV strains."
25040,Effects of Timely Control Intervention on the Spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection,"The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in South Korea in 2015 exerted huge social and economic tolls. Mathematical models are effective for understanding and controlling the spread of MERS-CoV, and so far, many attempts at applying mathematical models have been made to understand the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The control intervention was conducted during the MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea immediately after the confirmation of the index case. Using a mathematical model, we investigated whether the early risk communication with the general public and mass media is an effective preventive strategy."
25046,"Avian Group D Rotaviruses: Structure, Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Perspectives on Future Research Challenges","Enteric infections are one of the principal causes of diarrhea, which results in poor feed conversion efficiency and reduced growth, and hence leads to heavy economic losses for the poultry industry. These infections are caused by different agents, including viruses (rotavirus, coronavirus, astrovirus, reovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus etc.), bacteria (Salmonella, Enterococcus, E. coli) and protozoans (Cryptosporidium and Eimeria) [68] [69] [70] [71] . The clinical manifestations of these pathogens are almost similar. Hence, RVD must be differentiated from all of these enteric pathogens, as well as from the other groups of rotaviruses found in poultry."
25196,"microRNA-4331 Promotes Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV)-induced Mitochondrial Damage Via Targeting RB1, Upregulating Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein (IL1RAP), and Activating p38 MAPK Pathway In Vitro","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) 1 is an enveloped enteropathogenic coronavirus with positive-sense singlestranded RNA genome (1) . TGEV infects pigs and especially causes piglets up to 14 days of age high mortality, which can reach to 100% (2, 3) and result in numerous economic losses. Our previous work demonstrated that TGEV infection can reduce MMP, leading to mitochondrial damage (4, 5) . Mitochondrion, an organelle of eukaryocyte, not only acts as the energy metabolism factory, but also is involved in many key biological processes, such as apoptosis, pathogenic infection (6, 7) . Mitochondrion is a very sensitive organelle to microenvironmental changes in cells and much easier becomes dysfunction than other organelles (8) . Mitochondria, the major source of energy, in the form of ATP, are closely interconnected with cell death. Ca 2ϩ is essential for maintain mitochondrial function. However, Ca 2ϩ accumulation in mitochondria can impair mitochondrial function, resulting in a transient depolarization of MMP and reducing ATP production (9 -11) . Both Ca 2ϩ accumulation and MMP depolarization can cause mitochondrial damage, so the alterations of Ca 2ϩ level and MMP are used to assess mitochondrial function (12) . miRNAs are small noncoding RNA species containing about 22 nucleotides and contribute to regulating many cellular processes including apoptosis, development, differentiation, and cell cycle (13) . We previously reported that miR-4331 level was upregulated during TGEV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (14) . Whereas, whether miR-4331 participate in regulating TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage in PK-15 cells is unclear. According to GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of miR-4331 targets, miR-4331 targets can be enriched in mitochondria and mitochondria-related pathways. Therefore, we postulate miR-4331 can participate in regulating mitochondrial dysfunction in PK-15 cells. To investigate the regulatory effects of miR-4331 on TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage, miR-4331 mimics or mimics control was transfected into PK-15 cells and the proteomic analysis was performed using LC-MS/MS labeled by Tandem Mass Tags (TMT). Then we identified the targets of miR-4331 and detected the effects of miR-4331 target on mitochondrial damage and p38 MAPK pathway. We demonstrated that miR-4331 increased mitochondrial Ca 2ϩ level and decreased MMP via activating p38 MAPK pathway and upregulating expression of IL1RAP. Moreover, miR-4331 activated p38 MAPK pathway via targeting RB1 and upregulating IL1RAP. Our data suggest that miR-4331 could facilitate TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage in PK-15 cells via targeting RB1, promoting IL1RAP, and activating p38 pathway."

Initially identified in Europe in 1970's, PEDV was later detected in many Asian countries where it causes severe problems in pig populations. In North America, PEDV was first detected in the United States (US) in 2013, which rapidly spread across the US in the subsequent 2 years [2] [3] [4] . The diarrhea caused by PEDV can result in dehydration in suckling piglets and eventually up to 100% mortality, which caused significant economic loss to the US swine industry [5, 6] ."
25670,"Survival of the Enveloped Virus Phi6 in Droplets as a Function of Relative Humidity, Absolute Humidity, and Temperature","I nfectious diseases caused by enveloped viruses, such as influenza viruses and the coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of economic losses per year (1) (2) (3) . Both influenza and SARS exhibit seasonality, with increased incidence during wintertime in temperate regions and perhaps during the rainy season in tropical regions (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Understanding infectious disease transmission is a complex problem due to the many factors involved, such as environmental conditions, human activity (e.g., more crowding in buildings during wintertime), hygiene, and host susceptibility. Environmental conditions are particularly compelling to examine when considering seasonality due to clear changes in weather throughout the year in temperate regions."
25788,N-terminal Domain of the Spike Protein of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus as a New Candidate Molecule for a Mucosal Vaccine,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a causative agent of PED, was first described as a devastating enteric disease of pigs in the United Kingdom in 1971 (1) . PEDV is a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus that has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (2) . PEDV infection induces diarrhea, causing high mortality in suckling piglets and weight loss in older hogs, which have led to significant economic losses in the swine industry (3) . The PEDV genome consists of seven open reading frames encoding four structural proteins, the spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane protein, envelope protein, and nucleocapsid protein (4) . Among the structural proteins, the S glycoprotein consists of the S1 and S2 domains. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 protein has been considered a major target Ag inducing neutralizing Ab production, because it interacts with aminopeptidase N (APN), a functional receptor involved in PEDV infection, on the host cell membrane (5) . Based on the observation that PEDV infection occurs mainly in epithelial cells of the small intestine via the fecal-oral route, and gross lesions are detected in the gastrointestinal tract of PEDV-infected animals, the establishment of mucosal immunity is required to induce protective immunity against PEDV infection (6, 7) . However, a mucosal PEDV vaccine is not available, and inducing mucosal immunity is difficult with current PEDV vaccine materials, which are administered intramuscularly, because the gut mucosa has a unique immune system, into which Ags enter only from the intestinal lumen due to the lack of afferent lymphatic vessels in mucosal immune-inductive site, compared with that of the systemic immune system. Interestingly, recent reports suggest that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein also interacts with 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid, a possible sugar co-receptor, expressed on epithelial cells and aids in PEDV infection in the host (8) . Consequently, use of the NTD as a mucosal vaccine material is a plausible vaccination strategy to protect against PEDV infection."
25845,"The Impacts on Health, Society, and Economy of SARS and H7N9 Outbreaks in China: A Case Comparison Study","Impacts. The SARS epidemic brought great harm not only to peoples' physical and mental health, but also to the economy. It was estimated that Asian states lost USD 12-18 billion as the SARS crisis depressed travel, tourism, and retail sales [13] . SARS had a large impact on tourism and its related industries, and due to the spread of SARS, population movement in China and many counties decreased. Families reduced their demand for food, clothes, travel, and entertainment, and the numbers of guests in hotels declined sharply. As observed by officers from the Agricultural and Health Departments, After WHO announced that Beijing was an epidemic area and issued more stringent advice to international travelers and airlines, including recommendations on screening at certain airports, the international tourism, transport, and business sectors were seriously affected. For example, the mid-April Chinese enterprise summit in Beijing, hosted by the World Economic Forum, was delayed and the Rolling Stones concert planned for Beijing was cancelled.As observed by an international officer and a media journalist, During SARS, it was very obvious to see the status of Beijing which became a ghost city. We all know that Beijing has traffic jams every day, but [then] you worried whether you were speeding. It's never been seen before."

The 2003 SARS outbreak caused losses of USD 12.3-28.4 billion and an estimated decrease of 1% in GDP in China and 0.5% in Southeast Asia [15] . The social burden of SARS in Guangzhou meant less income and spending, with a rough estimate of the total economic burden of RMB 11 billion [16] ."
25845,"The Impacts on Health, Society, and Economy of SARS and H7N9 Outbreaks in China: A Case Comparison Study","At the same time personnel exchanges were reduced for fear of infection, and income decreased. There was also increased spending on prevention and healthcare, which had negative economic impacts on families. Interviews with 71 households in Qinling Mountain in Shaanxi Province indicated that in the second quarter of 2003 SARS caused the average annual household income to decline to US$175.44, 22 .36% below what was expected [18] ."

The economic impacts of H7N9 were less serious than SARS but still important to characterize. Studies show that the direct medical costs of hospitalization of a patient with H7N9 were estimated to be RMB 71 060, which is more than a year's income for a person in a rich province in China [20] . In April 2013, the H7N9 avian influenza epidemic caused the price index of meat and poultry and their products to fall to 101.5 on a year-on-year basis.

25845,"The Impacts on Health, Society, and Economy of SARS and H7N9 Outbreaks in China: A Case Comparison Study","China's emergency management of the two epidemics varied. After SARS, China's public health emergency management system developed very fast, and as a consequence emergency management greatly improved [30] . Despite the similarities of SARS and H7N9 and the fact that mortality of H7N9 was much higher than SARS, control efforts for SARS were slow to be mobilized and were heavily criticized and generally considered to be suboptimal, as the poor handling of SARS exposed serious information communication problems in the then emergency management system processes. In contrast, although the H7N9 has not been identified as a pandemic in China as there is limited person-to-person spread of H7N9 under specific circumstances such as poultry handling, the Chinese Government's response to H7N9 was much swifter and more transparent than it was in the SARS outbreak. Consequently, the social and economic impacts of H7N9 were not as serious as in the case of SARS. This points to the evolution of the emergency management system, highlighting how a transparent and rapid response can reduce the impacts of infectious disease outbreaks."

Understanding risk communication practice is an important element in understanding the different management responses to SARS and H7N9 and subsequent outcomes. The effectiveness of emergency preparedness and responses is highly dependent on the quality and amount of information that is available at any given time, and quality communication and coordination among partners is crucial. Information sharing and communication are considered key tools for the coordination of prevention and management of infectious diseases."

25934,Surveillance of respiratory viruses in the outpatient setting in rural coastal Kenya: baseline epidemiological observations,"Consistent with observations elsewhere 2,5,24 , most of the ARI outpatients in this study were young children under 5 years; 50.3% of the participants in this age group had a virus positive NPS sample. This demonstrates that the under 5's are a highly vulnerable age group for medically important ARI. The results are comparable to those from the outpatient health facilities in refugee camps and at a national referral hospital, in Kenya, where the proportions of virus-positive NPS samples in those under 5 years old with cases of ARI was 49.8% 25 and 54% 26 , respectively. This age group appears to experience the highest burden of acute illnesses linked to the studied respiratory viruses and should therefore be a focus for future intervention strategies. However, additional data should be collected on the social and economic burden of these viruses, such as days of school missed, medical costs and time off work for caregivers."

26298,Continuous Invasion by Respiratory Viruses Observed in Rural Households During a Respiratory Syncytial Virus Seasonal Outbreak in Coastal Kenya,"In conclusion, respiratory virus infections and associated illness in this setting are ubiquitous in households. The molecular screen of these specimens revealed continuous and considerable respiratory virus circulation and infection frequency in this population that varied with virus species and subject age. The study here unveils previously unknown patterns of respiratory pathogen circulation in a rural low-income population. The remarkable frequency of virus infections of multiple species and strains lends itself to an ecological analysis of interactions that may be influential in virus ecology. The etiology of respiratory disease and immunological burden of respiratory viruses in children is worthy of further study. In addition, investigation on the human virome in the nasopharynx would provide insight on these viruses and how they affect human health and disease. Future studies should address the health and economic implications of these observations."

The incidence of human zoonotic disease is estimated to surpass 1 billion cases per year, with novel emerging infectious diseases accruing hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses 7, 8 , losses that are greatly magnified when new emerging viruses such as coronaviruses (CoVs) devastate economically critical livestock populations across the globe. With the continued encroachment of human populations into animal habitats and our close contact with domesticated animals, zoonoses will continue to increase as the human and livestock population numbers and density expand over the next century. In fact, a recent study recognized that the majority of emerging infectious disease events have origins in wildlife 3, 8 , underscoring the importance of developing broadly applicable strategies for vaccine design for virus families that are harbored within extensive zoonotic pools."

PEDV and PDCoV are classified in distinct genera in the family Coronaviridae, as an Alphacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus, respectively (1, 2) . The transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), also an enteropathogenic porcine alphacoronavirus, used to be responsible for severe economic losses around the globe in the 1990s. However, due to its current disappearance in many parts of the world, this review will focus mainly on PEDV and PDCoV, the two emerging swine coronaviruses."

27739,Identification of Diverse Bat Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses in China Provides New Insights Into the Evolution and Origin of Coronavirus-Related Diseases,"With the discovery of diverse wildlife-borne CoVs in different regions of the world, previous studies have indicated that bats are the main and original natural reservoirs of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus (Calisher et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2012) . The special metabolic and immune systems allow bats to tolerate diverse viruses, and the social roosting behavior of many bat species lets them serve as ideal incubators for the occurrence of frequent co-infection, recombination, and intraspecies transmission of CoVs O'Shea et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015; Sola et al., 2015) . Although 15 years have passed without a recurrence of the SARS outbreak, the consistent discovery of SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) in Rhinolophus bats indicates an ongoing risk of SARS reemergence Balboni et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2016b; Hu et al., 2017) . Recently, a CoV of Rhinolophus bat origin, swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV), was found to be responsible for the death of 24,693 piglets across four farms in Guangdong Province (Zhou et al., 2018) . Besides similar clinical signs, the outbreak of SADS coincided with infection by another swine enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV; Zhou et al., 2018) . It is worth mentioning that a PEDV-related bat CoV, BtCoV/512, was previously identified in Scotophilus kuhlii bats (Tang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2016; Gerdts and Zakhartchouk, 2017; Zhou et al., 2018) .

27852,Aminopeptidase N-null neonatal piglets are protected from transmissible gastroenteritis virus but not porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,"Whether APN is the entry receptor for PEDV remains controversial. To resolve the paradox on the requirement of APN in PEDV infection, APN-null piglets were challenged with PEDV, which caused huge economic loss globally in recent years. All WT (n = 10) and APN-null (n = 7) piglets displayed lethargy and severe watery diarrhea by 24 hpi and died by 84 hpi. Meanwhile, the onset of these clinical signs was accompanied with the detection of PEDV in fecal samples between 24-72 hpi as determined by qPCR (Fig. 4C ) and ELISA (Fig. S2D) ."
27852,Aminopeptidase N-null neonatal piglets are protected from transmissible gastroenteritis virus but not porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,"In summary, we generate APN-null pigs via genome editing and reproductive cloning. Our results provide a clear role for APN in TGEV infection and suggest that APN may be dispensable for PEDV infection in neonatal pigs. Use of this genetic model is not only valuable in exploring further the role of APN in other biological functions but potentially reduce economic losses related to TGEV in swine industry."

Calf diarrhea is related to diverse and complex factors such as individual health conditions, management practice, rearing environment, as well as infectious causative agents. More than 50% of mortality in preweaned calves has been related to diarrhea, and most cases have occurred in calves less than 1 month of age [2] ."
28246,Characterization and Pathogenicity of the Porcine Deltacoronavirus Isolated in Southwest China,"Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA virus in the Coronaviridae family [34] and to date, they have been classified into four genera (α, β, γ and δ). Several alphacoronaviruses, such as PEDV and TGEV cause diarrhea and vomiting in piglets, leading to enormous economic losses in the swine industry [35, 36] . Swine enteric coronavirus (SeCoV), a recombinant between PEDV and TGEV reported in 2016, also causes diarrhea in swine [37] . Additionally, some novel alphacoronaviruses related to the bat coronavirus HKU2 have recently been reported in China; these viruses, porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) [38] , swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV), [39] and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) [40] are also major pathogens of diarrheal disease in swine. The deltacoronavirus, PDCoV, also causes diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in nursing piglets, and it is clinically indistinguishable from other enteric diseases caused by these porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus. Moreover, coexistence of pathogens, such as PDCoV and PEDV, PDCoV and PoRV, increase the mortality rate of infected piglets, which incurs massive economic losses to porcine industries [41] . Taken together, the pathogens associated with diarrhea in piglets have attracted much needed attention to the necessity for expanded preventative, diagnostic, and treatment measures."

This virus is known to cause an important disease that incurs a high economic loss in the poultry industry [2, 3] despite an ongoing vaccination program. It causes respiratory disease while also affecting the kidneys and reproductive tract [4] through viremia with a severity that differs depending on serotypes [3] . Mutations and recombination have produced a high genetic diversity of the virus. In addition, vaccinations performed in the farm setting can influence the evolution of the virus [5] . Many serotypes of IBV are often not cross-protective [6, 7] . Mismatching between the circulating strain and the administered vaccine may contribute to vaccination failure [7] . Ubiquitous IBV and IBV-like viruses have also been found in species other than chicken, such as in peafowl, guinea fowl, partridge, waterfowl, and teal [2, 6, [8] [9] [10] . This finding strengthens the possibility that IBV may have a wider range of hosts than previously thought [8, 6] . Despite this, data relating to IBV in Indonesia is still limited to poultry. Studies of diseases on endemic species are valuable for the conservation effort, yet are rarely conducted."
28360,Prevalence of Pathogens Related to Bovine Respiratory Disease Before and After Transportation in Beef Steers: Preliminary Results,"Our data should be considered preliminary because this study was limited by a number of factors. Firstly, due to the small number of events (three shipments, 112 samples) the logistic model was likely to suffer from small-sample bias. Secondly, the effects of other factors, such as age of the animals, driver, month, the number of farms per transport, climate conditions, space allowance and mingling were not considered, consequently, our results are valid only for the tested type of journey and animals. It is indeed well known that management conditions of the transport, distance travelled, season and geographic area of origin, are crucial elements in order to define the risk profile of developing BRD. Thirdly, the prevalence of the pathogens at the farms of origin and the number of farms per each shipment was not determined. This gap was due to the fact that the animals collected at the assembly point arrived from different local farms, and it was not possible to sample animals over there and we had no access to the documentation reporting the origin of each animal. However, sampling before loading provides a partial indication of the animal's health status. Lastly, a great limitation of the study is that it was not possible to split the effects of the stress due to transport from stress due to the adaptation to a new farm and to document how those stressors affect the immune system of the animals. It has been found that potential causes for BRD onset include stress associated with transport, adaptation to feed, the new social hierarchy, and viral exposure [1, 2] . It is well known that these stressors affect respiratory immunity, response to infection, bacterial growth, viral replication and the tissue repair process, and are responsible for an increase in cortisol release and a decrease in leukocyte numbers [20, 21] . Consequently, it has been suggested that, to reduce the economic cost of the disease, it may be more effective to focus on the host than the pathogens [1, 22] . Unfortunately, in this pilot study it was not possible to determine stress or other immunology biomarkers, thus further studies are needed to explain other possible causes of the increase in the prevalence of BRD pathogens in the nasal microbiome of beef steers after travelling. Our results need, therefore, to be confirmed in a larger dataset, including more events and evaluating the effects of multiple factors using multivariate regression analysis to provide useful guidelines to prevent the performance losses and poor welfare associated with BRD. Notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations, this preliminary study increased our knowledge of the prevalence of BRD in beef steers."
28386,Current Status of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea (PED) in European Pigs,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause a large variety of diseases in humans and animals. In pigs, coronaviruses affect various organs, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. CoVs have one of the largest genomes of all RNA viruses, which in combination with their high genetic diversity causes mutation and recombination, resulting in new virus variants (24) . Besides porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), the porcine coronaviruses comprise transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (26) . The clinical symptoms of PED are diarrhoea, vomiting, and dehydration which result in very high mortality among suckling piglets and large economic losses (5, 8, 21) . Various factors influence the clinical signs of PED, mainly the age of the animals, the herd's immune status, and the virulence of the strain (18) . Multiple PEDV strains are circulating on different pig farms around the world and they differ in virulence."
28386,Current Status of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea (PED) in European Pigs,"PED was observed for the first time in 1971 in the United Kingdom. The virus only infected fattening pigs and sows. Subsequently, the disease spread to other European countries. Emergence of a new PEDV strain in China in 2010 caused serious epidemics and this strain rapidly spread worldwide. In the USA, highly virulent strains infected pigs in 31 states between 2013 and 2015, resulting in significant economic losses (11, 12, 30) . The disease was characterised by rapid diarrhoea onset in pigs of all ages and mortality in suckling piglets reaching 95% (30) . In Europe, PED re-emerged in 2014 in Germany. Subsequently, highly similar strains were also found in several European countries (19, 36) . PED is not a notifiable disease in the European Union and is not on the list of diseases reported to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE), therefore the status of this disease is not fully recognised. In the last 10 years, only a few countries have reported clinical cases of PED and/or seropositive animals (4)."
28386,Current Status of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea (PED) in European Pigs,"The first symptoms of the disease in the USA were observed in April 2013 and were confirmed in the laboratory in May 2013. The PED virus had escaped from biosecurity and control systems, spread very quickly to other areas, and infected hundreds of farms. By March 2015, the presence of PEDV had been confirmed in 31 US states. PEDV epidemics resulted in significant economic loss there, and the domestic pig industry lost almost 10% of its population (seven million pigs) (3, 12) . The PED outbreak was characterised by watery diarrhoea, dehydration, and variable vomiting. All groups of animals were affected by the epidemics, but the highest mortality was 95% and occurred among suckling piglets (10, 15) . The strains isolated in the USA were genetically related to the Chinese PEDV strains reported in 2012. PEDV was probably dispersed in the USA mainly through contaminated trucks, but other factors that assist the spread of the virus cannot be excluded (15) . Two strains of PEDV have been identified in the USA: highly virulent NON-INDEL (USA/Kansas29/2013) and the milder variant S-INDEL (USA/OH851/2014) (2) . Both variants were classified to genotype 2. In experimental infections, S-INDEL strains showed lower pathogenicity and mortality (from 0% to 70%) than the NON-INDEL strains, where the mortality rate was up to 100% (2, 30, 36) . Since the PED outbreak in the USA, detection of highly virulent strains has also been reported in Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Ukraine. Detection of S-INDEL strains has been reported in most European countries (2, 12, 17) ."
28386,Current Status of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea (PED) in European Pigs,"PED is not notifiable in the European Union and is not on the list of diseases reported to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE), therefore, it is not possible to accurately describe the occurrence of this disease in Europe. In the last 10 years, only a few countries have reported clinical cases of PED and/or seropositive animals (4) . The PED outbreaks in Europe were significantly different from epidemics in the USA or Asia. After the epidemics in 2013 in the USA, PED cases were also confirmed in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Slovenia ( Fig. 2) (2, 18, 21) . Viruses identified in these European countries were very similar to USA/OH851/2014 strains. In Germany PED emerged in 2014, inflicting up to 70% mortality and typified by acute symptoms (30) . In Slovenia PED was confirmed in the laboratory in 2015 (23) . At almost the same time, highly virulent strains were described in Ukraine. These viruses were similar to USA/Kansas29/2013. So far, Ukraine is the only European country where highly virulent strains have been identified. Nevertheless, taking into account the occurrence of a virulent strain in Ukraine and its rapid spread, it is likely that epidemics similar to those in the USA may also occur in Europe (17, 30) . Considering the presence of PEDV in countries neighbouring Poland (Germany, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine) and the rapid spread of the virus, it is highly probable that PEDV will also be introduced to Poland. PED is a rapidly spreading global disease and causes large economic losses in pig production around the world. Frequently appearing mutations cause variability in its viral genome and can change the pathogenicity of the new PEDV variants. Biosecurity is a central to the prevention or spread of PEDV. Applying the principles of biosecurity protocols, it is possible to reduce the risk of introducing the virus into swine herds. Disinfection of vehicles entering farms is highly effective because contaminated faeces or vomit can be found on the wheels."
28529,"PEDV enters cells through clathrin-, caveolae-, and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis and traffics via the endo-/lysosome pathway","As a type of alphacoronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused enormous economic loss to the global pork industry, especially after the emergence of highly pathogenic PEDV variant strains in 2010. PEDV was first reported in 1971 in the UK [1] , and afterward was also discovered in Europe and Asia [2] [3] [4] [5] . Although PEDV has persisted in Asian swine-producing countries, it does not attract enough global attention. After October 2010, severe PED outbreaks occurred even in Chinese pig farms that were already vaccinated with CV777inactivated or live-attenuated vaccines [2, [6] [7] [8] . In 2013, the first PEDV outbreak occurred in the US and rapidly spread across the entire country [9] . Molecular epidemiological results show the genetic differences between classical (GI subtype) and new PEDV variant strains (GII subtype) [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9] . PEDV is presently recognized worldwide due to dramatic changes observed in its epidemic character, pathogenic properties, and gene drift [10] . Studies focused on its pathogenesis [11, 12] , immune evasion [13] and developing effective vaccines [14, 15] are progressing."
28738,Immunodominant SARS Coronavirus Epitopes in Humans Elicited both Enhancing and Neutralizing Effects on Infection in Non-human Primates,"A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was characterized in March 2003 after a global effort following the first epidemiological case in November 2002. 1 Ten years later (2012), a novel Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus emerged, which was a βcoronavirus, similar to SARS-CoV. 2 SARS is a deadly infectious disease and has the potential to seriously threaten public health and socioeconomic stability worldwide. 1 Serologic and genetic investigations indicate that SARS-CoV is of zoonotic origin, 3, 4 with bats as the likely animal reservoir. Since the identification of SARS-CoV in 2003, there have been major advances in understanding SARS-CoV genetics 1, 5, 6 and molecular epidemi-ology 7 and in identification of host receptors 8, 9 and T-cell epitopes. 10, 11 Models in mice, ferrets, and monkeys have been established, each with particular strengths and weaknesses. 12 Vaccine candidates have included DNA, a live attenuated strain, recombinant proteins, inactivated whole virions, and vector vaccines; 13 however, none have been approved through clinical investigation. 14 Safety concerns about a SARS-CoV vaccine have been raised, given the observation in vitro of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV infection that could, in theory, exacerbate disease. 15 Other observations include evidence of ADE reported here for the first time induced by an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in rhesus macaques ( Figure 1 ) and by antisera from SARS patients (Table S1) , as well as ADE in other coronavirus infections. 16−18 ADE in vitro has been observed for many other viruses, including yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza A virus. 19 −21 HIV-induced ADE has been described, 22, 23 but the exact mechanism is still uncertain. 24 Among other examples of ADE, secondary infection with dengue virus of a heterologous serotype has been associated with an immunopathologic vascular leakage and hemorrhagic syndrome, Dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/ DSS). 25 Most descriptions of ADE relate to Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) and/or complement components promoting viral uptake and virus replication pathways. 26−28 Goncalvez et al. reported that treatment of juvenile rhesus monkeys with the cross-reactive mAb 1A5, which recognizes the fusion loop in DII of Dengue virus, enhanced DV4 viremia by several logs within 3−6 days of infection. 26 Furthermore, a 9-amino acid (aa) deletion at the Nterminus of the CH 2 domain in the Fc region abrogated enhancement in vitro and in vivo, confirming that ADE occurred through an FcγR pathway for this class of antibodies. Another study analyzed the stoichiometric relationship between antibodymediated neutralization and enhancement of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in cells expressing FcγR. 29 The results showed that there is an antibody occupancy threshold on the virion for neutralization or enhancement of virus infection. Strongly neutralizing DIII-lateral ridge-specific mAbs inhibit at lower occupancy, whereas weakly neutralizing mAbs that bind distinct epitopes require a much higher mAb occupancy for neutralization. When mAb occupancy falls below the threshold for neutralization, ADE can occur. In subsequent studies, the same group showed that the level of antibody occupancy that promotes ADE in vivo is also modulated by the binding of C1q, which restricts ADE in an IgG subclass-specific manner. 30 On the basis of these studies, many neutralizing antibodies may enhance infection in vitro in FcγR + cells when their concentrations fall below a key occupancy threshold, and some Abs that poorly neutralize may strongly enhance over a wide dose−response range. However, for antibody isotypes that bind C1q avidly, much of the enhancing effect may be minimized in vivo."
28760,Genomic Characterization and Phylogenetic Classification of Bovine Coronaviruses Through Whole Genome Sequence Analysis,"Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) causes neonatal calf diarrhea, winter dysentery in adult cattle, and respiratory tract disorders in cattle of all age groups [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . BCoV infections in herds lead to a reduction in milk production, deterioration of health, and deaths of young animals, resulting in severe economic losses [6, 7] . In general, there are two different types (enteric and respiratory) of BCoVs based on disease symptoms. Although some previous reports have suggested that several candidate amino acids may contribute to the differences between the two disease types, it still remains unclear [8] [9] [10] ."
29006,Immune response characterization of mice immunized with Lactobacillus plantarum expressing spike antigen of transmissible gastroenteritis virus,"Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is classified under the genus Coronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales . It is one of the important determining causes of acute viral diarrhea in piglets and results in devastating economic losses in the swine industry (Xia et al. 2017b; Yu et al. 2017a) . It destructs the intestinal villi epithelium, resulting in a decrease in the surface area and atrophy of the epithelial lining, intestinal disorders, and incomplete food digestion and absorption Xia et al. 2017a) ."
29006,Immune response characterization of mice immunized with Lactobacillus plantarum expressing spike antigen of transmissible gastroenteritis virus,"TGEV is a highly infectious coronavirus (CoV) that causes diarrhea in piglets with a high morbidity and mortality rate leading to high economic losses (Zhang et al. 2017) . It causes inflammation in intestinal tissues, and usually, the death of the animal is mainly due to a sodium and potassium ion imbalance (Cruz et al. 2013) . So far, there is no effective treatment against the causative agent itself; the prescribed medication acts solely against the resulting clinical symptoms. This fact necessitates the development of an effective tool for viral control. Effective prevention and control of the TGEV and other coronaviruses can only be achieved through the use of vaccines (Gerdts and Zakhartchouk 2017) ."
29244,Interferon gamma inhibits transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection mediated by an IRF1 signaling pathway,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an economically important enteric coronavirus that causes acute viral enteritis [7] . TGEV infection causes vomiting, severe diarrhea, and dehydration, and the disease caused by this virus is the most severe in neonates, resulting in high morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets [8] [9] [10] . Previous reports have shown that TGEV infection in vitro and in vivo induces the production of a significant amount of IFNs including type I IFNs [11] [12] [13] . TGEV primarily infects intestinal epithelia in vivo, although infection of dendritic cells and macrophages by TGEV has also been observed [14, 15] . Most of the previous studies focused primarily on the capacity of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) to control TGEV infection. The ability of type II IFN-γ to inhibit TGEV infection has not been well explored, although many non-lymphoid cells, including epithelia, express IFN-γ receptors (IFNGR) [16] . The heterodimeric IFNGR complex is made up of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, is highly expressed on myeloid cells and lymphoid cells, and is also widely present in most types of cells, including intestinal epithelia [16, 17] . It is well established that the presence of antigen-specific IFN-γ + T cells is correlated with protection against rotaviruses, which, like TGEV, primarily infects intestinal epithelia and cause acute diarrhea [18] ."
29244,Interferon gamma inhibits transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection mediated by an IRF1 signaling pathway,"TGEV infection causes a highly contagious swine disease that results in serious economic losses to the pig industry. The development of effective anti-TGEV therapeutics is still very necessary. Here, we demonstrate that IFN-γ treatment directly inhibits the infection of ST cells and IPEC-J2 cells by TGEV. Moreover, in addition to the direct antiviral activity of IFN-γ, IFN-γ enhances the anti-TGEV activity of IFN-α and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with IFN-α. Since the inhibition of TGEV by IFN-γ occurs largely through the IRF1 pathway, IFN-γ would be predicted to play a vital role in protection of the host against TGEV infection in vivo."
29255,Molecular detection of enteric viruses from diarrheic calves in Egypt,"Calves within their first month are highly susceptible to viral diarrhea probably due to suckling milk, which neutralizes the acidic pH of their digestive tract and in turn allows several pathogens to survive [2, 38] . Several improvements in vaccination, medication and management have been implemented to reduce the incidence of NCD. However, NCD is still persistent because it is complex and multifactorial and can be triggered by several different infectious and non-infectious causes [2] . NCD has a devastating economic impact on cattle-raising businesses worldwide [2, 20, 21] . Direct losses are due to dehydration, reduced growth rate, and high morbidity and mortality. Indirect losses are due to the imposition of trade restrictions and increased costs of management and veterinary care as well as animal suffering. In Egypt, the diarrhea control programs are completely dependent on mass vaccination of animals using commercially available inactivated vaccines. Data on the detection, prevalence and typing of infectious diarrheal causes are not available, and this study was undertaken in an attempt to fill that gap."
29432,Antiviral effect of lithium chloride on infection of cells by porcine parvovirus,"Porcine parvovirus (PPV) is a member of the family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, genus Protoparvovirus. The parvoviruses are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses. PPV is a major cause of reproductive failure in sows and is a significant cofactor in porcine postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome [1] [2] [3] . PPV was first isolated from pigs with fever in 1965 [4] . It is commonly found in diseased pigs and is the cause of significant economic loss for the swine industry today [1, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Currently, vaccination is the primary measure for prevention of PPV. However, the costs of vaccinations are high and might lead to biological safety issues, such as recombination and mutation of viruses. Additionally, even with vaccination, PPV is widespread in swine. Although vaccination can prevent the clinical symptoms of the PPV disease, it cannot eliminate the impairment caused by PPV disease [10, 11] . Therefore, alternative strategies, such as drug therapies to control the PPV, should receive increased attention."

NCD has a negative impact on animal welfare and leads to economic losses to the livestock industry due to the costs of treatment and prophylaxis, increased susceptibility to other diseases, increased mortality, and long-term residual effects, such as reduced growth rates and milk production [2] [3] [4] [5] .

29544,Epidemiology of respiratory viruses in Saudi Arabia: toward a complete picture,"In Saudi Arabia, ARTI cases involved over 5 million (15.4%) of the population in 2013 [6] . The epidemiology, evolution, and circulation patterns of respiratory viruses in Saudi Arabia may be affected by two major factors. One is the presence of over 11.9 million foreign workers from more than 100 countries [7] . The movements of this huge number back and forth between their home nations and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia may help to introduce new viral strains. The second factor is the gathering of more than 10 million Muslims from approximately 184 different countries in the holy sites of Mecca and Medina during the Hajj and Umrah seasons. Pilgrims and foreign workers are a large heterogeneous population in terms of ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, including a markedly variable rate of lower RTIs [8] , and socioeconomic backgrounds. During the 3-to 4-day Hajj ritual, many pilgrims are confined in close proximity in tents and alleys [9, 10] . The overcrowding is ideal for the spread of respiratory viruses and is a major public health concern. Those who become infected can pass the respiratory viral infection on to others upon their return to their countries [11] [12] [13] [14] ."
29544,Epidemiology of respiratory viruses in Saudi Arabia: toward a complete picture,"HRSV is a highly contagious virus that causes lower RTIs in humans of different ages. One study described the infection of 33.8 million children, with 3.4 million hospitalizations and nearly 199,000 deaths. Almost all (99%) of the cases were reported from developing countries [87] . In addition, HRSV infections have a great economic impact, with annual direct medical costs having been estimated at $650 million in the United States alone [88] . Neonates and infants under 5 years of age are more prone to severe and even fatal HRSV infections [23] . Similarly, individuals with underlying risk factors, such as prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and congenital heart disease, and those with natural or induced immunodeficiency are at high risk of severe HRSV infection [89] ."
29544,Epidemiology of respiratory viruses in Saudi Arabia: toward a complete picture,"In an era of rapid global travel, viruses have no borders and can traverse countries and even continents within a few hours. Airports and other ports of entry to Saudi Arabia witness a dynamic movement of millions of pilgrims and foreign workers throughout the year. These huge numbers of people have different ethnicities, underlying clinical conditions, and socioeconomic backgrounds. They vary in their susceptibility to respiratory virus infections and represent a potential source of virus transmission to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Control measures at different ports of entry are a prudent strategy, particularly during the winter and Hajj seasons. In addition, pilgrims should be advised to follow vaccination programs before performing the Hajj ritual. This will help to reduce the spread of virus beyond the Hajj season, both to other parts of Saudi Arabia by domestic pilgrims and to other countries by international pilgrims. More research studies that clarify the epidemiology, phylogeny, and evolution of respiratory viruses are urgently required to predict and reduce the impact of future epidemics. "
29585,Genomic characterization and pathogenicity of porcine deltacoronavirus strain CHN-HG-2017 from China,"During a molecular surveillance study performed by Yuen and coworkers in 2012, PDCoV was first identified in swine specimens in Hong Kong [10] . Following the first detection of PDCoV in pigs with diarrhea in Ohio, USA, in [4, 5, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Piglets infected with PDCoV are characterized by watery diarrhea, variable vomiting, and dehydration [3] . Notably, PDCoV-positive piglets are frequently co-infected with other enteric viruses, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), which considerably increases the morbidity and mortality of piglets [17] . PDCoV outbreaks have been reported in many countries worldwide and have caused significant economic losses in the pork industry. Moreover, due to the unique genome replication strategy of coronavirus, PDCoV undergoes RNA mutation and recombination events at high frequency, giving rise to new variants, which makes it extremely difficult to control and eliminate [18] . In 2015, Saif and coworkers reported that a PDCoV strain named OH-FD22 caused severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by severe diarrhea and vomiting in gnotobiotic piglets [19] . Macroscopic examination revealed that the jejunum and ileum are the major targets for PDCoV infection, and the pathological lesions were similar to, but milder than, those caused by PEDV [19] . Subsequently, the pathogenicity of several American strains, including USA/IL/2014, Michigan/8977, and Ohio CVM I, was investigated in piglets [20] . These American strains exhibited pathogenic characteristics similar to those of OH-FD22. In addition, it has been reported that newborn piglets inoculated with two recent Chinese PDCoV isolates, named CHN-HN-2014 and CHN-GD-2016, developed clear clinical signs, including severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration [21, 22] ."
29585,Genomic characterization and pathogenicity of porcine deltacoronavirus strain CHN-HG-2017 from China,"PDCoV is a newly emerged enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes diarrhea, dehydration and death in neonatal piglets. Since PDCoV was first reported in Hong Kong, it has spread to many countries around the world, leading to significant economic losses in the pork industry."
29919,Evaluation of relationship between Rotavirus and Coronavirus infections with calf diarrhea by capture ELISA,"Calf diarrhea, one of the most widespread diseases, is a complex syndrome with a complex etiopathogenesis, causing important economic losses due to morbidity and mortality, treatment costs, and reduced growth rates in affected calves (Garaicoechea et al. 2006; Reidy et al. 2006) . The etiology of this syndrome involves infectious agents (viruses, bacteria, and protozoa) and also noninfectious factors such as herd management, host nutritional, and immunological condition which affect the outcome of the disease (Brussow et al. 1992; Maes et al. 2003; Garaicoechea et al. 2006) ."
29919,Evaluation of relationship between Rotavirus and Coronavirus infections with calf diarrhea by capture ELISA,"Group A Rotaviruses, as the member of Reoviridae family, have clearly been established as causing significant diarrheal disease in infants and in the young of various mammalian and avian species (Brussow et al. 1992; Murphy et al. 1999; Flint et al. 2000; Estes and Kapikian 2001) .Group A bovine rotavirus (BRV) is considered the major cause of severe diarrhea in calves worldwide (Garaicoechea et al. 2006) . Coronaviruses as the member of Coronaviridae family are associated with economically important diseases in cattle, poultry, pigs, and cats (Lai et al. 2007; Acheson 2007) . Bovine coronavirus (BCV) causes diarrhea in both dairy and beef calves worldwide (Radostitis et al. 2007 ). Since diarrhea in calf and other animals is a great problem which involves economic losses, several diagnostic methods are used to detect enteropathogenic agents. Diagnosis is done through collecting feces of animals suffering from diarrhea by a rectal swab or collecting intestinal contents (Castro and Heuschele 1992) and using laboratory diagnostic tests such as direct electronmicroscopic test, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), latex agglutination, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and also immuno-electron microscopy (Parwani et al. 1992; Radostitis et al. 2007 ). Among these methods, ELISA using monoclonal antibody, as a sensitive, fast, and inexpensive method could be used for the simultaneous detection of bovine coronavirus, bovine rotavirus group A, and also other enteropathogenic factors in the feces of diarrheic calves (Crouch et al. 1984; Radostitis et al. 2007) . In this study, to examine the possible involvement of BRV and BCV in calf diarrhea, a case-control study by using capture ELISA, was performed in dairy farms around Mashhad, Iran."
29919,Evaluation of relationship between Rotavirus and Coronavirus infections with calf diarrhea by capture ELISA,"Due to spread of intestinal infections outbreak all over the world and the out coming mortality, these infections along with severe diarrhea in many young animals and children are of great importance (Gumusova et al. 2007 ). In young calves, diarrhea is considered as one of the most important diseases, because the resulting economic loss following mortality, treatment costs, and decrease of growth rate would be detrimental (Maes et al. 2003) . Indeed, long-term effects of diarrhea on the health and efficiency of calves cured from clinical courses of the disease may cause more economic loss (Fuente et al. 1998) . Rotavirus, Coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Cryptosporidium parvum are four major pathogens accompanied by diarrhea in young calves around the world. These organisms are responsible for most of the intestinal infections (75-90%) in young calves in the world. Different species of Salmonellae are also of importance in dairy calves (Athanassious et al. 1994; Fuente et al. 1998; Radostitis et al. 2007 ). To increase the production of each cattle without increasing the number of live stocks, it is important to detect causative factors of diarrhea in calves so as to use, based on this information, the effective preventive methods for decreasing the mortality of calves in the first months of their life (Perez et al. 1998) . In this study, along with determining the BRV and BCV prevalence in diarrheic calves, a case-control study was performed to examine possible involvement of BRV and BCV in diarrhea in some dairy farms around Mashhad, Iran. Many other studies reported the prevalence of BRV and BCV in scouring calves over the world. The presence of BRV in six and BCV in two samples out of nine fecal samples from diarrheic calves with 10-60 days of age was reported in Sao Paulo, Brazil (Brandao et al. 2007 ). The other study in Turkey showed the presence of BRV antigen and BCV antigen in diarrheic calves, 41.17% and 1.96%, respectively. In healthy calves, BRV was detected in 4.08% and BCV was not detected (Gumusova et al. 2007 ). In a case-control study in Costa Rica on dairy and beef calves younger than 3 months, by using dot-ELISA test, Rotavirus was detected in 7% and 2% of scouring and control calves, respectively, and Coronavirus in 9% and 1%, respectively. In 25% of diarrheic calves and 21% of healthy ones, there were not any infectious factors and viruses were found in infected calves younger than 1 month more predominantly (Perez et al. 1998 ). In Spain, by using a commercial ELISA kit, Rotavirus was detected in 42.7% and Coronavirus was found in 7.3% of fecal samples from diarrheic calves. Mixed infection with Rotavirus and Coronavirus was found in 5.1% of the total samples of feces, among which, in 2.3% of fecal samples, the only enteropathogens found were Rotavirus and Coro- (Fuente et al. 1998) . In another study on 218 fecal samples from diarrheic dairy calves, 1-30 days old, rotaviral infection was detected in 46.2%, 45.6%, 33.8%, and 48.3% of the calves in the respective age groups of 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, and 22-30 days. There was no significant differences in the detection rate of rotaviral infection among calves on the different age groups (Garcia et al. 2000) .The other study reported the presence of BRV in 10% of fecal samples of dairy calves younger than 3 months in Costa Rica (Hird et al. 1990 ). In a study in Switzerland, the prevalence of bovine rotavirus and Coronavirus in infected calves with age of 1-21 days, were 58.7% and 7.8%, respectively (Uhde et al. 2008) . In Iran, the presence of Rotavirus, Coronavirus, and other enteropathogens in feces of calves were studied in farms in Tehran (Kargar et al. 1981; Keyvanfar et al. 2001 ), Arak (Qaem Maghami et al. 2000 , northwest of Iran (Khalili et al. 2006), and Khouzestan (Mayameei et al. unpublished Uhde (58.7%) , and Mayameei (48%), there was significant difference in determined rate of prevalence for Rotavirus in diarrheic samples. The determined rate of prevalence for Coronavirus in diarrheic feces in this study (3.17%), in some cases, has considerable difference with studies by Gumosuva (1.96%), Perez (9%), Foente (7.3%), Garcia (20.4%), Uhde (7.8%), Qaem Maghami (34%), and Khalili (12.03%). The number of samples and the range of age for the studied calves, sensitivity of the employing detection method, season of sampling, management and hygienic situation of the ranches, nutritional situation of calves, rainfall and humidity rate, and other factors were not identical in these studies, which all of them can influence on the results. Specially, in cold seasons, increase of pollution and presence of sensitive calves and crowding would cause the prevalence rate of rotaviral and coronaviral infection to increase. The range of age in which sampling is performed and also the kind of husbandry (dairy or beef) surely affect the prevalence. In this study, although infection with Rotavirus and Coronavirus in diarrheic calves was more than that of healthy ones, there was no significant relationship between BRV and BCV infection with diarrhea based on statistical analysis. So the role of other enteropathogens in the occurrence of calf diarrhea could be considered in this study. It is also possible that some healthy calves, which were recognized positive for Rotavirus and Coronavirus in ELISA test, had been in the beginning of the disease process without any clinical signs of diarrhea. Although, according to the short incubation period of diarrhea caused by BRV and BCV, this would be an unlikely event. By considering the prevalence of BRV and BCV in diarrheic calves in different age groups (Table 2) , it is concluded that the rate of BRV infection in third week is higher than the other age groups and the lower rate of BRV infection is related to age older than 1 month. This could be attributed to the presence of colostrum antibodies and strong local immunity, particularly in the first week and almost the second week which decrease the occurrence of rotaviral diarrhea in the first 2 weeks. After decreasing of local passive immunity and the occurrence of natural rotaviral infections in the third and fourth weeks of life and subsequent activation of local host immunity, the rate of viral infections drop in calves older than 1 month."
30135,Molecular characterization of a Chinese vaccine strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus: mutations that may contribute to attenuation,"Members of the Coronaviridae, within the order Nidovirales, contain positive-stranded RNA genomes that range from 27 kb to 31 kb in size [1] . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), together with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and the human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HKU1, belongs to the genus Alphacoronaviruses (http:// www.ictvonline.org/). TGEV is an enveloped virus that contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of about 28.5 kb in length. Its genome includes nine open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins (spike [S], envelope [E] , membrane [M], and nucleoprotein [N]), and five nonstructural proteins (the replicases 1a and 1ab, proteins 3a and 3b, and protein 7) in the order 5 0 -replicase (1a/1b)-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3 0 [2] . TGEV was initially identified as the etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in swine in 1946 in the United States [3, 4] . In neonates, TGEV infects the epithelial cells of the small intestines, leading to potentially fatal gastroenteritis. The virus can also lead to infection in the upper respiratory tract and less often, in the lungs [5] . In adults, TGEV causes mild disease. In swine, it is the major cause of viral enteritis and fetal diarrhea in neonates, resulting in significant economic losses [6] ."

30264,Comparison of trends in the quantity and variety of Science Citation Index (SCI) literature on human pathogens between China and the United States,"Pathogenic microorganisms are the common enemy of humankind and many countries are increasing the level of research relating to pathogenic microorganisms, especially the United States (US) (Franco and Sell 2011; DeFrancesco 2004; Fauci 2006b ) and other developed countries. China and other developing countries are following a similar trend in order to safeguard human health and to enhance national innovation, even with the significant economic restrictions compared with developed countries. The quantity and quality of scientific literature relating to pathogenic microorganisms are important indexes or parameters for evaluating the level of study and the degree of attention focused on pathogenic microorganisms. The Science Citation Index Expanded database (http://apps.isiknowledge.com) is an internationally recognized tool for academic journal evaluation. Moreover, this database facilitates statistical analysis of literature by country, year and institution."
30452,"Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus: a comprehensive review of molecular epidemiology, diagnosis, and vaccines","Several PEDV vaccines, which differ in their genomic sequence, mode of delivery, and efficacy, have been developed. A cell culture adaptation of the CV777 strain had a strikingly different genomic sequence [18] , was associated with much lower virulence in new born caesarean-derived piglets, and caused much less severe histopathological changes. However, in Europe, the disease caused by PEDV was not of sufficient economic importance to start the vaccine development. Therefore, the trial of vaccine development was mainly accomplished in Asian countries where the PEDV outbreaks have been so severe that the mortality of the new born piglets was increased. An alternative vaccine for suckling piglets may be an attenuated form of the virus derived from serial passage (passage level: 93) of the PEDV [86] . In Japan, a commercial attenuated virus vaccine of cell cultureadapted PEDV (P-5V) has been administered to sows since 1997. Although these vaccines were considered efficacious, not all sows developed solid lactogenic immunity [87] ."
30452,"Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus: a comprehensive review of molecular epidemiology, diagnosis, and vaccines","Research into this and other potential vaccines should be made a priority, as PEDV-mediated diarrhoea causes significant economic losses in the swine industry. However, there is also a potential drawback to the use of live-attenuated vaccines. Recently, a survey conducted in China indicated close phylogenetic relationships between a Chinese PEDV field strain (CH/GSJIII/07) and two vaccine strains, suggesting that live vaccines can evolve into more infectious forms in the field [42] ."
30507,An epidemiological study of winter dysentery in fifteen herds in France,"The losses due to the disease, especially in milk production, which may decrease by 25 to 100% over two weeks, were investigated by Rollinson (1948) , Hedstrom and Isaksson (1951) , Johnston (1959) and Charton et al. (1%3) . However, Campbell and Cookingham (1978) suggested that these earlier estimations were pessimistic. The aim of this study conducted in France during 1984-85 was to determine the factors responsible for the onset of the disease, their chronology, the clinical signs and the economic consequences to the farmer."
30507,An epidemiological study of winter dysentery in fifteen herds in France,"Interpreting the data The output from the computer constitutes a set of figures, each representing a plane with two factorial axes. The points configure the projection of the cloud of individuals and of the cloud of variables. The interpretation step consists in grouping the more similar individuals and variables. Different computer programs may help in the interpretation of the factorial analysis (hierarchical ascending classification, aids to interpretation etc.) and have been used systematically (Jactel et aZ., 1990) . In the factorial analysis, the first three factorial axes are interpreted and the individuals and the variables whose contributions are the highest are retained. It is then possible to define a group of herds with frequent winter dysentery outbreaks by a set of management variables. It is also possible to describe and analyse a winter dysentery outbreak by a set of clinical epidemiological and economical variables."
30507,An epidemiological study of winter dysentery in fifteen herds in France,"The overall attack rate ranged between 22 and 90% in the herds studied. In mild outbreaks, the maximum decrease in milk production compared to a theoretical lactation curve (Wood, 1%7) ranged between 6 and 11%. The overall production drop persisted for 8 to 15 days, after which former milk production levels were regained. It is noteworthy that when milk production returned to preclinical levels ( Figure 4 ) the observed lactation curve exhibited a rapid rise compared to the theoretical curve. In severe outbreaks the maximum decrease in milk production was 30% and lasted for an average of 2g days. The later return to initial level followed the same pattern as for the mild outbreaks. In late lactation, winter dysentery could lead to premature drying-off. In both cases, the mean fat and protein content of bulk milk declined by 1.5 g/l in the assay performed immediately after the period of diarrhoea. In this evahtation of the economic consequences, the cost of treatment and the indirect effects of weight loss on reproduction performance were not taken into account (Table III) . "
30507,An epidemiological study of winter dysentery in fifteen herds in France,"As in previous studies (Scott et al., lm, Horner et al., 1976) , no Campylobader jejuni was detected in the faeces (Table IV) . This observation, together with the results of the coronavirus test on the faeces, confiims the possible involvement of a coronavirus in the aetiology of winter dysentery (Komarov et &., 195% Charton et al., l%% Espinasse et al., 1981; Van Kruiningen et uZ., 1985) and its association with calf coronavirus (Horner et al., 1976; Durham et al., lm, Akashi et al., 19a, Espinasse et uZ., 1981) . A recent study by Van Kruiigen et ~2. (1987) , which seemed to demonstrate a marked antigenic relationship between the coronavirus isolated from winter dysentery outbreaks and calf diarrhoea coronavirus, was confirmed by Saif et uZ. (1988) . Nasal discharge is always observed in affected animals. Some other coronaviruses are known to bc involved in respiratory disorders (Thomas et d., 198Z Saif et uZ., 1986) . However, our survey indicates that faccal excretion of viral particles is very rapid and transient. It may even start during the period of hyperthermia prior to any sign of diarrhoea, which could explain the difficulty in detecting a coronavirus in affected cattle (Van Kruiningen et uL, 1985) . It would be advisable to examine the faeces for the presence of virus as soon as the rectal temperature exceeds 3YC. 3n The frequency of outbreaks of the disease in a herd may vary from a few months to 10 years and our observations suggest that immunity may last for two years. In herds reguhuly exposed to the disease the outbreaks wouid be rather miid, whereas when the inter& between recurrences are large (> 3 years) the outbreaks wouId be more severe on an economic basis."
30507,An epidemiological study of winter dysentery in fifteen herds in France,"AnaIysis of individuaI production curves shows more accurate estimation of miik loss than a study of the herd mean production (Kahrs et al., 1973) . Loss of miIk production ranged between 25% and 95% in severe cases but in miId outbreaks miIk 37g production was little affected. The later rapid rise in the lactation curve would correspond to the effect of treatment or to a reaction after a prolonged decrease in production (Lucey er &., 19%) . Generally speaking, economic studies have a tendency to overestimate the production losses but to underestimate the economic consequences to the farmer, which include the animal's weight loss, the effect on their future reproduction performance and the cost of treatment."

30668,Virus safety of intravenous immunoglobulin: Future challenges,"The world changes continuously, and we are now living in a phase called globalization. The socioeconomic impact of globalization on humankind has both direct and indirect impacts on the emergence of pathogens. Three factors are important for emerging pathogens to occur (Fig. 5) : Microbe-host interactions, adaptation of the microbe to the environment, and colonialization of the environment by a potential host. Globalization increases long-distance trade and travel, urbanization (often in dense, impoverished settlements), pressure on land reserves, and migration into these lands. Climate change also influences the environment, the host, and the microbes. Therefore, we expect new and resurging pathogens in the future. However, countermeasures, such as treatments, prophylaxis, and surveillance, and the capability to rapidly investigate and react to new threats on a global scale have also evolved over the past 50 yr. Therefore, it is not possible to make predictions about the severity of future outbreaks of emerging pathogens."
30668,Virus safety of intravenous immunoglobulin: Future challenges,"Plasma-derived therapeutics are life-saving products. However, like other biologics, they carry the inherent risk of transmitting pathogens. Current virus elimination methods used in the plasma processing industry contribute to the high safety standard of these medicines. These methods also proved to be effective against recently encountered emerging viruses such as SARS or WNV. Nevertheless, virus transmissions may still occur as reported for clotting factors and a fibrin sealant (39, 40, (87) (88) (89) . Efforts to increase the repertoire of countermeasures against small and nonenveloped viruses are ongoing ( 41, 53, 90) . As we have outlined, an increase in the frequency of emerging viruses may be expected in the future because of socioeconomic and ecological changes. However, the impact this would have on blood safety is difficult to estimate."
31202,A crucial role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in SARS coronavirus–induced lung injury,"It has been estimated that the Spanish flu virus that killed more than 20 million people at the beginning of the twentieth century was lethal to around 0.5% of infected people 9,10 , whereas the lethality of SARS-CoV infections reached 10% even with modern intensive care treatment [1] [2] [3] . Given this very high lethality of SARS and the enormous economic and social impact of the worldwide SARS outbreak, elucidation of the disease pathogenesis is crucial for future treatment in case of renewed outbreaks. Moreover, a recent outbreak of avian influenza A (H5N1) in humans resulted in up to 70% lethality from acute respiratory failure 12 . Before the discovery of SARS-CoV, two coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) were known to infect humans, but they caused only self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections (30% of the common colds) and had never been reported to cause severe illness 27 . The molecular determinants that may account for the dramatic differences in pathogenesis between these human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV were unknown."
31577,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak: a quick online cross-sectional survey","The correct answer rates of the 12 questions on the COVID-19 knowledge questionnaire were 70.2-98.6% (Table 1 ). The mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 10.8 (SD: 1.6, range: 0-12), suggesting an overall 90% (10.8/12*100) correct rate on this knowledge test. Knowledge scores significantly differed across genders, age-groups, categories of marital status, education levels, and residence places (P<0.001) ( Table 2 ). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that male gender (vs. female, β: -0.284, P<0.001), age-group of 16-29 years (vs. 30-49 years, β: -0.302, P<0.001), marital status of never-married (vs. married, β: -0.215, P<0.001), education of bachelor's degree or lower (vs. master degree and above, β: -0.191 ~ -1.346, P<0.001), and occupations of unemployment (β: -0.158, P=0.040) and students (β: -0.234, P<0.001) (vs. mental labor) were significantly associated with lower knowledge score (Table 3) . The majority of the respondents agreed that COVID-19 will finally be successfully controlled (90.8%). Rates of reporting ""disagree"" and ""I don't know"" were 1.9% and 7.3%, respectively. The attitude towards the final success in controlling COVID-19 significantly differed across genders, education levels, occupation categories, and residence places (P<0.05). In additions, respondents reporting ""disagree"" and ""I don't know"" had significantly lower knowledge scores than those reporting ""agree"" (P<0.001) ( .001) were significantly associated with the answer of ""I don't know"" on A1 (Table 5) ."
31577,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak: a quick online cross-sectional survey","The strength of this study lies in its large sample recruited during a critical period, the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Nevertheless, compared to the most recent national population statistics of China [21], our sample was obviously over-representative of women, well-educated people, and people engaging in mental labor. Given the significant associations between these demographic variables and KAP towards COVID-19 revealed in this study, we may have overestimated knowledge and rates of preventive practices and underestimated rates of positive attitudes towards COVID-19 of Chinese residents. Considering that educational attainment and occupation are often used as proxy measures of socioeconomic status [22] , strictly speaking, our findings can only be generalized to Chinese populations of a relatively high socioeconomic status, particularly women."
31577,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak: a quick online cross-sectional survey","In summary, our findings suggest that Chinese residents of a relatively high level of socioeconomic status, in particular women, have had good knowledge, optimistic attitudes, and appropriate practices towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, good COVID-19 knowledge is associated with optimistic attitudes and appropriate practices towards COVID-19, suggesting that health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for encouraging an optimistic attitudes and maintaining safe practices. Hopefully, under the combined efforts of Chinese authorities and all Chinese residents, China surely will win the battle against COVID-19 in the near future. Due to the limitation in representativeness of the sample, more studies are warranted to investigate the KAP towards COVID-19 among Chinese residents of a low socioeconomic status."
37312,The aetiology of SARS: Koch's postulates fulfilled.,"Finally, one may wonder whether the recent emergence of SARS and the emergence of avian influenza A outbreaks, which also have resulted in animal to human transmissions with fatal consequences (de Jong et al. 1997; Claas & Osterhaus 1998; Webby & Webster 2003; Hien et al. 2004) , in Southeast Asia and more particularly in Guandong Province of China, may be a result of key socio-economic changes in that region (T. Kuiken and A. D. M. E. Osterhaus, unpublished data) . It may be argued that given the worldwide nature of these changes, the observed increase in the emergence of such virus infections in this area may herald the beginning of a global trend for which we are ill prepared (Kuiken et al. 2003b (Kuiken et al. , 2004 ."

The maternal education levels were used as a designation of socioeconomic status. Significant associations of seropositivity with demographic and other factors were further tested with multiple logistical regressions. Significant associations of the antibody levels with age, gender, maternal education, smoking status, race, and season were tested using multiple linear regressions. Potential cross-reactivity between coronavirus strains was assessed using linear regression models. All analyses were performed with STATA version 10 (STATA Corp. LP, College Station, TX). Given the exploratory nature of this study, the data were not corrected for multiple comparisons."
37390,Development of a Nucleocapsid-Based Human Coronavirus Immunoassay and Estimates of Individuals Exposed to Coronavirus in a U.S. Metropolitan Population,"For each demographic and other factor (age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and season of the blood draw), we tested the number of negative versus positive individuals in each category using chi-square contingency tables. For analyses based on cutoff values from the children's data, HKU1 was significantly associated with race ( 2 ϭ 7.1047; df ϭ 2; P Յ 0.029) ( Table 1 ). Using this primary cutoff limit, none of the other coronaviruses showed any significant associations with any of the listed variables. We then tested the high seropositivity cutoff designations and found that OC43 was significantly associated with race ( 2 ϭ 7.4335; df ϭ 2; P Յ 0.024) and smoking status ( 2 ϭ 4.6912; df ϭ 1; P Յ 0.030) and NL63 was significantly associated with maternal education ( 2 ϭ 10.2358; df ϭ 4; P Յ 0.037) ( Table 2) . High-cutoff-point seropositivities for 229E ( 2 ϭ 17.5643; df ϭ 3; P Յ 0.001), NL63 ( 2 ϭ 22.4689; df ϭ 3; P Յ 0.0001), and OC43 ( 2 ϭ 11.1342; df ϭ 3; P Յ 0.011) were also significantly associated with the season of the blood draw, with the highest levels of antibodies observed during the summer months."
37390,Development of a Nucleocapsid-Based Human Coronavirus Immunoassay and Estimates of Individuals Exposed to Coronavirus in a U.S. Metropolitan Population,"In our demographic analyses, race, socioeconomic status, and smoking status were all identified as risk factors for coronavirus exposure. Higher rates of seropositivity were observed in African Americans, smokers, and individuals of low socioeconomic status. All three of these risk factors have been previously shown to render individuals more prone to a variety of respiratory illnesses (2, 5, 11). The demographic factor as- sociations were particularly evident in individuals with higher antibody titers, suggesting that these risk factors are linked to recent infections. Similarly, higher antibody levels were significantly associated with the season of the blood draw, and the highest coronavirus immunoreactivity occurred during the summer months. It is possible that in this population of adults and especially in those individuals deemed at risk, these summer bouts could represent either a persistent infection or a reinfection with the same coronavirus strain (1). Amino acid identity among the four coronavirus nucleocapsids is overall generally low (35.4 to 68.2%), thus making the nucleocapsid protein a useful strain-specific diagnostic antigen (8) . Nevertheless, defining the extent of the cross-reactivity among the coronavirus nucleocapsids remains an ongoing issue. Recent results regarding the degree of cross-reactivity between the SARS nucleocapsids and each of the non-SARS nucleocapsids (8, 12) are mixed, and in these studies, it was not possible to assess the degree of cross-reactivity among the non-SARS strains. Our study was not designed specifically to test cross-reactivity; however, the correlation between the antibody levels of different strains was evident, with the expected highest association observed between viruses within the same phylogenetic group (i.e., between NL63 and 229E [group I] and between OC43 and HKU1 [group II]). The cross-reactivity between group I strains has previously been suggested in a serological study of NL63 and 229E in children and young adults (17) . In this study, portions of the nucleocapsid genes were expressed and certain amino acid regions of the NL63 recombinant proteins were detected by 229E antisera in Western blots. Although our use of the whole nucleocapsid sequence may have contributed to a certain degree of crossreactivity, the absence of reactivity to the feline coronavirus nucleocapsid indicates that genus-and group-specific crossreactivity cannot completely explain the correlation between antibody levels to the different human coronavirus strains. Because the feline virus is more closely related to NL63 and 229E than to OC43 and HKU1, the correlation observed between the group I and group II coronaviruses is likely to reflect a shared exposure rather than cross-reactivity. In our study, we also have evidence for intragroup monospecificity of individual strains. For example, 32% of the 196 individuals who were seropositive for OC43 were seronegative for HKU1. With re- spect to the group I viruses, 5.6% of individuals were seropositive for either NL63 or 229E but not for both. The extent of the cross-reactivity to the nucleocapsid proteins of human coronaviruses will need to be addressed in future studies by competitive inhibition experiments with purified nucleocapsid proteins. Documenting relative levels of seroprevalence of coronavirus strains is important, particularly given the recent emergence of the SARS virus as a serious pathogen. The assay that we have developed is a straightforward and sensitive means of tracking the four known human non-SARS coronaviruses, and its application will likely benefit epidemiological studies of these viruses."
40116,Preliminary crystallographic analysis of avian infectious bronchitis virus main protease,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the prototype of the genus Coronavirus (Spaan & Cavanagh, 2004; Lai & Holmes, 2001) , the members of which can infect humans and multiple species of animals, causing a variety of highly prevalent and severe diseases (Spaan & Cavanagh, 2004; Ziebuhr, 2005; Pereira, 1989; Lai & Holmes, 2001) . For instance, a previously unknown human coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the emergence of which was most likely to have been the result of animalhuman transmission (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005) , was identified as the aetiological agent of a global outbreak of a life-threatening form of pneumonia called severe acute respiratory syndrome (Peiris et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Drosten et al., 2003) . From their genome sequences, coronaviruses can be classified into three distinct groups (Spaan & Cavanagh, 2004) . IBV belongs to group III (Lai & Holmes, 2001) , which only infects avian species, and leads to a highly contagious disease affecting the respiratory, reproductive, neurological and renal systems of chickens, resulting in a drop in egg production in adult birds and damaging the developing reproductive system in young birds. IBV infection predisposes chickens to infection with secondary pathogens. The incidence of IBV-related nephritis can result in high mortality rates (Siddell et al., 2005; Cavanagh, 2005; Ignjatovic & Sapats, 2000) . IBV infection is prevalent in all countries with an intensive poultry industry, with the incidence of infection approaching 100% in most locations, causing great economic loss worldwide (Ignjatovic & Sapats, 2000) . At the present time, control of IBV relies almost exclusively on vaccination and management (Holmes, 2001; Siddell et al., 2005) . However, there are two major problems associated with the use of vaccines. Firstly, there are many serotypes of IBV; secondly, there is at least circumstantial evidence to suggest that new serotypes may emerge by recombination, possibly involving the live vaccine virus itself (Lee & Jackwood, 2000; Cavanagh, 2003) ."
41557,Assessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19),"Although the COVID-19 epidemic was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO), the WHO specifically called upon member states to not restrict the freedom of movement of persons as a result of the epidemic [21] . However, member states did not adhere to this recommendation and have varyingly restricted the free movement of people from China [22] . Such restrictions were most drastic in China, where some cities were put on complete lockdown [22] . These political decisions regarding movement restrictions must balance the expected epidemiological impact with predicted economic burden-the latter of which we did not examine. While securing a few days delay to epidemic spread in China would secure time for healthcare systems in Chinese cities that have not yet been affected to prepare for the appearance of case-patients [20] , the impact of such a delay outside China is not substantial enough to accomplish meaningful prevention, such as the development, manufacturing, and distribution of a vaccine."

41600,Functional pangenome analysis suggests inhibition of the protein E as a readily available therapy for COVID-2019,"The current epidemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a rising global health emergency (WHO https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) with disruptive health, social and economic repercussions. Three major actions, confinement, detection and therapy are required to contain this pandemic. Detection and therapy can be guided by virus sequence data, which was first made available in 17 December, 2019 at gsaid.org, soon after detection of the first cases. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data are a pivotal resource on its own, but can gain greater value when embedded within those of other Betacoronavirus, allowing a comparative pangenomic analysis. This approach can help identify the core genome of Betacoronaviruses and extract accessory genomic features shared by a subset of these viruses or unique to SARS-CoV-2. Whereas core genomic features are required for the virus to be functional, accessory features are candidates to provide insights into the drivers of the unique capacities of SARS-CoV-2 explaining its spread and virulence. Genome annotation and structural modelling can then be used to assess the possible functions of these accessory features and guide approaches to detection and treatment."
41607,Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China,"An initial exponential growth of confirmed cases is generically expected for an uncontrolled outbreak and in most cases mitigated with a time delay by effective containment strategies and policies that reduce transmission and effective reproduction of the virus, commonly yielding a saturation in the cumulative case count and an exponential decay in the number of new infections. Although in Hubei the number of cases was observed to grow exponentially in early January [9] , the * bfmaier@physik.hu-berlin.de subsequent rise followed a sub-exponential, super-linear, algebraic scaling law t µ with an exponent µ = 2.3 (between Jan. 24th and Feb. 9th), cf. Fig. 1A . For the majority of the affected Chinese provinces of Mainland China, however, this type of algebraic rise occured from the beginning, lacking an initial exponential growth altogether. Surprisingly, the exponent µ does not vary substantially with a typical value of µ = 2.1 ± 0.3 for the confirmed case curves in other substantially affected provinces (confirmed case counts larger than 500 on Feb. 12th), despite geographical, socio-economical differences, differences in containment strategies, and heterogeneties that may have variable impacts on how the local epidemic unfolds, cf. Fig. 1B and C."
41705,Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation,"Our analysis is based on the complete ""tracking and recording"" information of imported cases and local cases detected in the province of Shaanxi province [7] , as this allows us to generate a data set that includes the time series of daily latent, infected and hospitalized cases. Since the outbreak scale in the Province of Shanxi was relatively small and this is subject to stochasticity in both case importation and local cases generated by the importation and since the Provincial data has detailed information on symptom onset and serial intervals, we adopt a method developed by Nishiura and Chowell [15, 16] to estimate the effective reproduction number, and we revise some of our early deterministic models to a novel discrete stochastic model to address the key issues relevant to preventing a secondary outbreak of COVID-19 in other provinces except for Hubei, due to the anticipated gradually relaxing of travel restriction and returning to normal social and economic activities."

In Wuhan, where the largest number of infected people live, residents were required to measure and report ther temperature daily to confirm their onset, and those with mild and asymptomatic infections were also quarantined in ""Fang Cang"" hospitals, which are public spaces such as stadiums and conference centres that have been repurposed for medical care. 11 The average interval from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation has dropped from 12 days in the early stages of the outbreak to 3 days in early February, highlighting how the efficiency of disease detection and diagnosis has greatly improved. 15, 16 Third, inner-city travel and contact restrictions were implemented to reduce the risk of community transmission. This involved limiting individual social contact, using personal hygiene and protective measures when people needed to move in public, and increasing the physical distance between those who have COVID-19 and those who do not. 11 As part of these social distancing policies, Chinese government encouraged people to stay at home as much as possible, cancelled or postponed large public events and mass gatherings, and closed libraries, museums, and workplaces. 17, 18 Additionally, to fully cover the suspected incubation period of COVID-19 spread before Wuhan's lockdown, the CNY and school holidays were also extended, with the holiday end date changed from January 30 to March 10 for Hubei province, and Feb 9 for many other provinces. [19] [20] [21] The implementation of these NPIs has coincided with the rapid decline in the number of new cases across China, albeit at high economic and social costs. 15, 16 On February 17, the State Council required localities to formulate differentiated county-level measures for precise containment of the COVID-19 outbreak and the restoration of socioeconomy affected by the outbreak. 22 The timing of implementing and lifting interventions is likely to have been and continue to be important, to take advantage of the window of opportunity to save lives and minimize the economic and social impact. 23, 24 The increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 outside China and establishment of secondary transmission in multiple places highlights its pandemic potential.

41922,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"The benefit from closing schools during an epidemic is to reduce transmission and new cases. Cauchemez et al. estimated that extended school closures in France could reduce H5N1 influenza cases by 13-17%. 2 Bayham et al. show that schools are likely places for transmission among US children. 3 However, Bayham et al. also show voluntary behavioral changes, without mandatory shutdowns, appeared to reduce cases of the 2009 H1N1 influenza on the order of 10-13%. In a systematic review, focused on influenza and school closures, Jackson et al. find some evidence that school closures are effective, but that the empirical evidence does not resolve how or when to close schools. 4 Furthermore, they find school closure mostly reduces infection in school children. Koh et al. do not find strong evidence that school closures prevent the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease. 5 Adda finds that while school closures do reduce incidence in France, the economic costs are large. 6 The benefits of school closure are often estimated relative to a baseline of no voluntary changes in behavior, but it is likely that the correct baseline for forcasting the school closure effect on COVID-19 includes other voluntary behavioral changes."
41922,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"The potential benefits of school closures must be balanced with the costs. Smith et al., Lempel, Epstein, and Hammond, and Adda analyze the economic impacts of school closures. 1, 6, 7 Schooling is one of the most important investments we make in our children's futures, and we do not have good estimates of how prolonged school closures influence drop-out rates and future earnings. This uncertainty makes a holistic assessment of tradeoffs challenging."
41922,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"Setting aside the economic costs and focusing on reducing mortality, school closures still create a tradeoff. Many healthcare workers must reduce time spent providing patient care, running diagnostic tests, and tracing contacts, and increase time caring for their own children. This tradeoff should not be ignored because the capacity to care for infected individuals and trace contacts directly influences the development of an epidemic, the survival of infected patients, and ultimately cummulative mortality from the pathogen."
41932,Effects of Chinese strategies for controlling the diffusion and deterioration of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in China,"COVID-19, a new and severe epidemic, has threatened public health and economic development in China [7] . As of March 6, 2020, the number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 has reached 100,000 worldwide, and some countries such as Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran are also suffering from the rapid spread of COVID-19 [4, 7, 8] . The need for greater attention and intervention strategies to curb the spread of COVID-19 around the world is of paramount importance."
41958,Generalized logistic growth modeling of the COVID-19 outbreak in 29 provinces in China and in the rest of the world,"However, for this forecast to come true, all European countries need to coordinate and fight together to avoid another major outbreak like in Italy. The situation in the United States is also at the very beginning stage, and may pose significant health and economic risks to the world in absence of serious measures."
41989,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"For infectious diseases, the number of infected people usually increases first before reaching a peak and then drops. This pattern implies that for a linear equation of new cases on the number of cases in the past, the unobserved determinants of new infections are serially correlated. The unobserved determinants of new cases may be serially correlated, also because they measure persistent factors, such as people's habit and government policy. Serial correlations in errors give rise to correlations between the lagged number of cases and the error term, and ordinary least square (OLS) estimator may be biased. Combining insights in Adda (2016) and the existing knowledge of the incubation period of COVID-19, we construct instrumental variables for the number of new COVID-19 cases in the preceding two weeks. Weather characteristics in the previous third and fourth weeks do not directly affect today's number of new COVID-19 cases after controlling for the number of new COVID-19 cases and weather conditions in the preceding first and second weeks. Therefore, our estimated impacts have causal interpretations. We use the Lasso method to select instrumental variables among eleven weather characteristics that have the highest predictive power for the average number of new confirmed cases during each of the past two weeks. Furthermore, we examine the moderator effects of socioeconomic factors on the transmission of COVID-19 in China, which include population flow out of Wuhan, the distance between cities, GDP per capita, number of doctors, and contemporaneous weather characteristics. We focus on the effect of population flows from the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak, because data on real time travel between cities have recently become available and we examine whether it can explain the disease spread, and that Wuhan is a major city and a transportation hub with significant population movements."
41989,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"We find that the stringent quarantine and public health measures imposed in late January significantly decreased the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the spread of the virus had been contained in China. While many socioeconomic factors moderate the spread of the virus, the actual population flow from the source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. Our analysis contributes to the existing literature in two aspects. First, our analysis is connected to the economics and epidemiologic literature on the influencing factors of and ways of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Existing studies find that reductions in interpersonal contact from holiday school closings (Adda, 2016) , reactive school closure (Litvinova et al., 2019) , public transportation strikes (Godzinski and Suarez Castillo, 2019) , strategic targeting of travelers from high-incidence locations (Milusheva, 2017) , and paid sick leave to keep contagious workers at home (Barmby and Larguem, 2009, Pichler and Ziebarth, 2017) can reduce the prevalence of influenza."
41989,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"Additionally, literature find that epidemics spread faster during economic booms (Adda, 2016) , increases in employment are associated with increased incidence of influenza (Markowitz et al., 2010) , and growth in trade can significantly increase the spread of influenza (Adda, 2016) and"

41989,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"A main objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of various social and economic factors in mediating the transmission rates of the virus, which may help identify potential behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors for infections. For within city transmissions, we consider the mediating effect of population density, degree of economic development, number of doctors, and environmental factors such as temperature, wind and rain. To measure the spread of the virus from Wuhan, we include an estimate of the number of people traveling from Wuhan. The empirical model including these mediating variables is as follows,"

Most studies on the socioeconomic impacts of climate change have found that estimation results are insensitive to the choice of the cutoff distance (Zhang et al., 2017) . We also used other cutoff distances (e.g., 150km) for robustness checks, and the main results remain unchanged. These results are available upon request."
41989,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"We investigate the impacts of many social, economic and environmental variables in mediating the transmission rates (Eq. (3)). For own city transmissions, we consider the mediating effects of population density, per capita GDP, number of doctors, contemporaneous temperature, wind speed and precipitation. For between-city transmissions, we consider the mediating effects of distance, density difference and per capita GDP difference. We also include a measure of population flows from Wuhan. Table 6 reports the estimation results of the IV regressions using the first half sample, and Table 7 reports the estimates for the second half sample."
41989,Impacts of social and economic factors on the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China,"Our main conclusions still hold with these mediating factors included. The effects of past infections are much smaller in the second half sample, suggesting that the virus outbreak has been contained. For the between-city transmissions, population flow from Wuhan poses a risk for new infections in other cities, with one week lag in the first half sample, and with two week lag in the second half sample. The effects are robust with the inclusion of other measures of proximity, such as those based on geography and economic similarity. Table 8 shows variables that affect transmissions within cities and whose coefficients are statistically significant at 0.1. In order to help compare across variables, we compute the changes in the variables needed in order for the coefficient of past infections on current cases to be reduced by 1. The effects of the environmental factors and population density are mixed. We also observe that the transmission rate is lower in cities with more doctors. Cities with higher per capita GDP have higher transmission rates, which may be due to more social interactions as a result of more economic activity 17 . However, until clearer mechanisms are identified and tested, this should be interpreted with caution."
41997,Impact of the contact and exclusion rates on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic,"We think that the more realistic scenarios are these in which the contact rate varies over time. In early phase of the epidemic, the contact rate may be reduced only by forcing people to stay at home; in the latter phase, when the number of daily cases exceeds a threshold, people isolate themselves to reduce the risk. In such scenario the number of daily new cases reaches peak proportional to an assumed ""fear"" threshold and then slowly decreases due to the decreasing fraction of susceptible individuals. Such scenario seems more realistic and, although devastating for both the economy and social life, grants time to develop and administer vaccine. Historical data on 1918-1919 H1N1 influenza pandemic suggest also that this ""fear"" threshold may not be constant in time, because people suffering from prolonged quarantine may tend to accept higher risk. When this ""negligence"" effect is included, one may obtain trajectories for which fast growth is followed by a plateau and then relatively fast decrease of daily cases. A bit surprisingly, this scenario, although not resulting from centrally imposed preventive policies, may be the most plausible non-containment scenario balancing health and economic costs."

42023,Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China,"In this analysis, we examined the temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces. Our analyses suggest a positive timelagged association between human migration and the incidence of COVID-19. We identified 3 distinct clusters of provinces based on the timing and strength of associations: 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lagged association, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Provinces that are closer to Wuhan and have more passenger influx from Wuhan experienced a more prolonged impact from migration. The correlations between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence were weaker in economically advantaged provinces. Furthermore, we estimated that All rights reserved.

This is equivalent to a 39% reduction in expected cumulative incidence, suggesting that transportation control is an effective intervention to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in the absence of cure and immunization."

42175,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"In this study, we examine the economic feasibility of developing and supporting a portfolio of vaccines for the world's most threatening emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) as determined by scientific experts, drawing from the list of targets made by the recently launched global initiative, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) (1) (2) (3) . Our portfolio is composed of the 141 preclinical assets identified by Gouglas et al. to be targeting the priority diseases."
42175,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"Uncontrolled outbreaks of EIDs, defined as infections that have ""recently appeared within a population, or those whose incidence or geographic range is rapidly increasing or threatens to increase in the near future"" (5) , have the potential to devastate populations globally, both in terms of lives lost and economic value destroyed. Notable recent outbreaks of EIDs include the 1998 Nipah outbreak in Malaysia, the 2003 SARS outbreak in China, and the 2014 Ebola outbreak. In addition to the thousands of lives lost, the economic costs of these outbreaks are estimated as $671 million, $40 billion, and $2.2 billion, respectively (5) (6) (7) (8) ."
42175,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"As the world becomes more globalized, urbanized, and exposed to the effects of climate change, the danger of infectious diseases has become an even greater concern (9), as emerging and re-emerging strains become more diverse, and outbreaks become more frequent. While distinct from the emerging infectious diseases, influenza serves as the best example of the destruction that viruses with pandemic potential can inflict on the modern world. As a baseline, avian influenza outbreaks in the U.S. since late 2014 have caused economy-wide losses estimated at $3.3 billion domestically, and have significantly disrupted trade (10) . The 1918 influenza pandemic, however, is estimated to have infected 500 million people and killed 3-5% of the world's population. In 2006, Dr. Larry Brilliant stated that 90% of the epidemiologists in his confidence agreed that there would be a large influenza pandemic within two generations, in which 1 billion people would sicken, 165 million would die, and the global economy would lose $1 to $3 trillion (11) (see Supplementary Materials for further discussion). Controlling EIDs before they have the chance to reach comparable scale represents a significant opportunity to prevent similar loss. few economic incentives for manufacturers to develop preventative vaccines for EIDs, due to the high costs of R&D and the uncertain future demand. Even if protection against these emerging diseases were immediately achievable with existing technology, development costs are significant (12) , as they are for any pharmaceutical development program. Pronker et al. (13) estimate that it costs between $200-900 million for a new vaccine to be created. Failure to gain approval also poses a substantial risk, as successful passage through clinical trials only occurs 6-11% of the time (13, 14) . Regulatory challenges are particularly prominent in EID vaccine development, as viable candidates are rarely available for distribution during outbreaks, making safety and efficacy testing difficult. As a result, vaccine development for EIDs has been reactive and technologically conservative (15) ."
42175,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"Of course, this subscription model considers only the development cost of vaccines. Once developed, the production and stockpiling of these vaccines would require further funding, but the subscription model can be applied on an ongoing basis, and at a much lower annual cost. Access to these vaccines by non-G7 countries must also be considered, but such access involves political and ethical issues that are beyond the scope of this economic analysis."
42175,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"These results suggest that a government-led subscription model is financially feasible and would likely yield significant economic and political benefits to all participating governments. While the usual challenges of broad multi-national cooperation must be overcome, early traction from organizations such as Civica Rx suggests that focused, inclusive collaboration can ensure sustained supplies of life-saving drugs (32). "
42175,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"Vaccines only sell for a fraction of their economic value, in some cases for only a few dollars. They provide myriad benefits, like enabling would-be patients to live longer, healthier lives (33, 34) , and bearing yet-undervalued gains in productivity and positive externalities to society at large (35) (36) (37) . Although the low price of vaccines is meant to benefit individuals and regions with lower incomes, in the long run, it has had the opposite effect, causing them to be medically underserved due to a lack of vaccine investment. Pharmaceutical companies and investors are directing their resources to projects in which the estimated return on investment is more predictable and lucrative. Vaccine prices are currently set far below the prices of drugs that treat other serious conditions, such as cancer, despite the enormous societal value of vaccines in general, and those to ensure global health security in particular."
42175,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"In addition to pricing, another challenge lies in assessing the future demand for EID vaccines. Due to the inherent unpredictability in the scale and timing of outbreaks, the future demand for a specific EID vaccine is typically unclear. An additional factor is geopolitical. Diseases that are traditionally found in only a few, lower-income countries may not attract as many R&D dollars because generating a return on investment is more difficult in those limited markets (25, 38) . While wealthier governments might issue purchase agreements to assure vaccine sponsors of returns (38), these commitments are more difficult to secure for EIDs in lower-income countries or those undergoing economic hardship. However, an increasing number of stakeholders are realizing the danger of this dynamic for low and high-income countries alike, as under epidemic outbreak conditions, diseases like Zika and Ebola have the potential to spread much further than their traditional locales. The Ebola outbreaks in West Africa in 2014 demonstrate how the absence of vaccine demand prior to an event may result in a tragic loss of life and a regional economic setback. It is a significant concern that years after those outbreaks, the demand for Ebola vaccines remains limited and uncertain, allowing gaps in preparedness to persist (39) (40) (41) ."
42175,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"Unless these market challenges are addressed, the global population will remain vulnerable to substantial human and economic losses when epidemics and pandemics arise."
42175,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"Perhaps key to the problem of EID vaccine funding is a deficiency in the pricing of the risk of infection by EIDs. Although the prevention of epidemics and pandemics saves countless lives and billions of dollars of economic value, the revenue realized by vaccine manufacturers is only a very small fraction of this value. With this in mind, an examination of a capitated fee structure-a subscription model-applied to vaccine development and acquisition is promising. Under the current model, vaccines are purchased a la carte after outbreaks begin."
42175,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"As past efforts demonstrate, the key to generating interest in developing vaccine assets is to offer sufficient financial incentives for would-be developers, such as direct market commitments or priority review vouchers. Closing the gap between the economic value of"
42175,Financing Vaccines for Global Health Security,"In Table S9 , we find that the expected return of the portfolio increases as the cost per project decreases. Similarly, Table S10 reports that the expected return of the portfolio increases as the probability of success of each project increases. However, even under more optimistic assumptions, the expected annualized return of the megafund for the base case remains significantly negative, increasing from -61.1% to only -57.4% when the probability of success is increased by 150%. This sensitivity analysis underscores the robustness of our results, and demonstrates that an EID vaccine portfolio remains economically unviable even under relatively optimistic cost and revenue assumptions."
42211,Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England: a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults,"The COVID-19 pandemic may cause excess mortality over the next year in the population both because of deaths among those infected, and because people who are not infected are experiencing social and economic upheaval; meanwhile the ability of health services to provide high quality of care for both infected and uninfected patients is increasingly threatened."
42213,The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"Populations in almost every country are now currently weighing whether, or when, the health benefits of anti-contagion policies are worth the costs they impose on society. For example, restrictions imposed on businesses are increasing unemployment, 19 travel bans are bankrupting airlines, 20 and school closures may have enduring impacts on affected students. 21 It is therefore not surprising that some populations hesitate before implementing such dramatic policies, particularly when these costs are visible while their health benefits -infections and deaths that would have occurred but instead were avoided or delayed -are unseen. Our objective is to measure this direct benefit; specifically, how much these policies slowed the growth rate of infections. We treat recently implemented policies as hundreds of different natural experiments proceeding in parallel. Our hope is to learn from the recent experience of six countries where the virus has advanced enough to trigger largescale policy actions, in part so that societies and decision-makers in the remaining 180+ countries can access this information immediately."
42213,The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"We employ well-established ""reduced-form"" econometric techniques 23, 24 commonly used to measure the effect of policies 25, 26 or other events (e.g., wars 27 or environmental changes 28 ) on economic growth rates. Similarly to early COVID-19 infections, economic output generally increases exponentially with a variable rate that can be affected by policy or other conditions. Unlike process-based epidemiological models, 7-9, 12, 22, 29, 30 the reduced-form statistical approach to inference that we apply does not require explicit prior information about fundamental epidemiological parameters or mechanisms, many of which remain unknown in the current pandemic. Rather, the collective influence of these factors is empirically recovered from the data without modeling their individual effects explicitly (see Methods). Prior work on influenza, 31 for example, has shown that such statistical approaches can provide important complementary information to process-based models."
42213,The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"To construct the dependent variable, we transform location-specific, sub-national time-series of infections into first-differences of their natural logarithm, which is the per day growth rate of infections (see Methods). We use data from first-or second-level administrative units and data on active or cumulative cases, depending on availability (see Appendix Section 2). We then employ widely-used panel regression models 23, 24 to estimate how the daily growth rate of infections changes over time within a location when different combinations of large-scale social policies are enacted (see Methods). Our econometric approach accounts for differences in the baseline growth rate of infections across locations due to differences in demographics, socio-economic status, culture, or health systems across localities within a country; it accounts for systemic patterns in growth rates within countries unrelated to policy, such as the effect of the work-week; it is robust to systematic under-surveillance; and it accounts for changes in procedures to diagnose positive cases (see Methods and Appendix Section 2). The reduced-form statistical techniques we use are designed to measure the total magnitude of the effect of changes in policy, without attempting to explain the origin of baseline growth rates or the specific epidemiological mechanisms linking policy changes to infection growth rates (see Methods). Thus, this approach does not provide the important mechanistic insights generated by process-based models; however, it does effectively quantify the key policyrelevant relationships of interest using recent real-world data when fundamental epidemiological parameters are still uncertain."
42213,The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"We estimate a multiple regression version of Equation 6 using ordinary least squares. We include a vector of sub-national unit-fixed effects θ 0 (i.e. varying intercepts captured as coefficients to dummy variables) to account for all time-invariant factors that affect the local growth rate of infections, such as differences in demographics, socio-economic status, culture, or health systems. 24 We include a vector of day-of-week-fixed effects δ to account for weekly patterns in the growth rate of infections that are common across locations within a country. We include a separate singleday dummy variable each time there is an abrupt change in the availability of COVID-19 testing or a change in the procedure to diagnose positive cases. Such changes generally manifest as a discontinuous jump in infections and a re-scaling of subsequent infection rates (e.g. See China in Figure 1 ), effects that are flexibly absorbed by a single-day dummy variable because the dependent variable is the first-difference of the logarithm of infections. Denote the vector of these testing dummies µ."

42224,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"In the absence of a vaccine, social distancing remains the only option to slow down the spread of the disease and arrest potential mortality. Governments around the world are now enacting aggressive policies, including ""shelter in place"" and emergency closures of all nonessential services, which carry severe economic and social consequences. For example, in the last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and the White House have recommended extreme social distancing in order to slow down the current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (5). However, these measures are less aggressive than what has been put in place elsewhere (6) . There is still a great deal of uncertainty as to how strong social distancing recommendations must be or how long they must last. Importantly, national and regional social distancing policies are likely to impact individual cities differently."
42224,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"Cities are predicated on extensive and intense socioeconomic interactions. Many of their measurable properties -from the size of their economies, to their crime rates, to the prevalence of certain infectious diseases -are mediated by socioeconomic interactions. These interactions are subject to well known scaling effects, which are magnified by city population size (7) . All of these relationships are tied to socioeconomic networks with average degree (number of social connections per capita) that increases approximately as a power law of city size k(N ) = k 0 N δ , with δ 1/6 (7, 8) ."

First, it is particularly important for larger cities to act quickly to contain this outbreak. Second, social distancing will impact cities differently based on city size. From the perspective of containing the outbreak, larger cities require more aggressive social distancing policies, corresponding to a larger p R . At the same time, once the outbreak is contained it might be possible to relax social distancing policies in smaller cities first, allowing a faster return to normal life and economic activity compared to more populous cities."

The ability to succeed against a fast emerging epidemic like COVID-19 depends on preserving as much person-to-person connectivity (e.g., through technology), while stopping disease transmission."
42224,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"Research on safe types of socioeconomic contact and exchange is therefore paramount so that we can succeed in controlling this outbreak while maintaining livelihoods, socioeconomic capacity, and mental health. This can in principle be done through approaches that make the most of emerging, real-time data to create context appropriate suppression strategies at local, regional, national, and global levels."
42224,COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size,"The higher socioeconomic connectivity of larger cities in a fast urbanizing world makes containing emergent epidemics harder. But the density of socioeconomic connections in cities can also facilitate the spread of information, social coordination, and innovations necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19.

42263,Targeted adaptive isolation strategy for Covid-19 pandemic,"Our model and conclusions relies on the separation of the population based on age and health into two compartments with very different outcomes. Of course there could be a certain grey area where the separation between the two subpopulations is not always clear. In this case the separation should be determined as a usual trade-off between resources available and risk. The immunity may not be complete but from the limited information currently available on Covid-19, it appears to be fairly robust. In the absence of alternative options available the development of population level immunity could be the optimal resolution of the global pandemic at least in regions where the infection is already widespread, e.g. in Western Europe. Some countries, for example Italy and Spain, implemented severe social distancing, but so far seems to be unable to stop the progress of the epidemic and may in fact be on track towards achieving large scale immunity in the population. However, with too much focus on the implementation of uniform social distancing and no clear targeted measures for identifying and efficiently protecting the vulnerable sub-population can lead to a very dangerous scenario with high mortality in spite of the high social and economic costs of an extended and potentially recurrent epidemic.

42305,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","This pathogen represents a significant challenge for public health, pandemic planning, and healthcare systems. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible (4) (5) (6) (7) . It causes moderate to severe clinical outcomes in approximately 20% of all recognized infected individuals (5, 8, 9) . In the absence of a vaccine, public health responses have focused on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (10) . These NPIs include: (1) ""case-based"" measures such as testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, and (2) ""non-case-based"" measures such as reducing the probability of transmission given an effective contact (e.g. hand hygiene, and cough etiquette), and social distancing measures to reduce the contact rate in the population. Social distancing minimizes opportunities for person-to-person transmission of the virus to occur. These social distancing measures include some combination of school closure, teleworking, cancellation of group activities and events, and a general overall reduction in community contacts. While they are expected to be effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they are also associated with substantial economic costs and social disruption."
42305,"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 transmission and mitigation strategies in the population of Ontario, Canada","Societal disruption measures could include outcomes such as the overall duration of time that the intervention needs to be to achieve the associated reductions in morbidity and mortality. A challenge for pandemic response using NPIs is that, in a fully susceptible population, although NPIs may slow disease transmission while they are in place, once the intervention is lifted (or compliance with the intervention becomes low), the transmission of the pathogen rebounds rapidly (10, 12) . In the case of COVID-19, it may not be possible to minimize morbidity and mortality, and societal and economic disruption at the same time."

While severe illness, particularly in older individuals, is frequent enough to overwhelm a society's ICU capacity (19) , mild unrecognized illness (particularly in younger individuals) contributes to spread (20) , and epidemics may only be recognized when superspreader events occur (21) , often in vulnerable settings like health care facilities (22) . In contrast to SARS (23), the high frequency of mild cases means that strategies which focus on case identification and isolation alone are likely to fail (22) . Control strategies for COVID-19 thus need to balance competing risks: the risks of mortality and health system collapse, on the one hand, against economic risks and attendant hardships (and health consequences) on the other. In this work, we evaluated plausible strategies for attenuating the COVID-19 epidemic in Ontario, Canada. We focussed on ICU resources for two reasons: first, because this component of most health systems represents a scarce resource prone to being saturated; and secondly because such saturation results in abrupt surges in casefatality, as individuals with acute respiratory distress syndrome will die quickly without the .

Initially reported in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and potentially linked to a zoonosis related to a wild animal market, COVID-19 has spread globally very rapidly, and World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic on March 11 th 2020. As of March 25 th 2020, there are 416,686 confirmed cases and 18,589 confirmed deaths, with 197 countries affected (WHO, www.who.int, data accessed on March 23 rd 2020), becoming the biggest health emergency of the 21st century. Because there is currently neither effective treatment nor vaccine, the main measure taken by nations has been social distancing first, and then partial or total preventive lockdown afterwards, deriving in the biggest global economic crisis also of the 21st century."
42373,Projecting the Spread of COVID19 for Germany,"There is no need to stress the importance of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) for public health, economic consequences and well-being of individuals. Yet, there is a need for more knowledge about objective information and reliable predictions of how the pandemic will likely evolve in the months to come. How large is the risk of any individual to get infected on a particular day or within a week? How does this risk change over time? How large is the expected number of individuals ever infected and how large is the number of individuals infected at any point in time? The latter question is the main concern of the public, politicians and health practitioners to ensure su¢ cient provision of health services. Finally, what are the e¤ects of policy interventions that are already implemented and that are being discussed? This paper starts by describing what we know quantitatively about the spread of the Corona epidemic in the Chinese province of Hubei and in South Korea. This o¤ers insights from two episodes of epidemics that seem to be coming to an end and that help in making predictions for other countries. We then compare the time-series evidence from Hubei and South Korea with cross-sectional information in European countries."
42373,Projecting the Spread of COVID19 for Germany,"Why should economists work on an epidemic? The economic costs of COVID-19 are huge and seem to be larger than those of the …nancial crisis starting in 2007. 4 This paper provides a model that allows to understand the spread of the disease. We employ a model in the tradition of search and matching models originating from Diamond (1982) , Mortensen (1982) and Pissarides (1985) . The basic structure of these models (continuous time Markov chains) is identical to epidemiological models (as becomes clear very quickly when reading overviews like e.g. Hethcote, 2000) . Compared to standard search and matching models, we do allow for four states, however. We extend the typical matching framework from a technical perspective by taking the stochastic nature of transitions and their prediction for the probability to be in various states into account. These probabilities are described by forward Kolmogorov equations. As we work with a discrete number of states, we obtain an ordinary di¤erential equation system. 5 The conclusion discusses various next steps that should be undertaken to understand economic consequences of COVID-19 better. We believe that our framework can form the basis for an understanding of economic costs of the pandemic."

We afterwards look at South Korea and very brie ‡y at Japan. We focus on the evolution of the number of individuals that were ever reported to be sick during the current epidemic. This number, by construction, can only rise. We chose Hubei and South Korea as the epidemics seem to come to an end in these countries. Given the huge uncertainty about long-run infection rates and individual risk to get sick after an infection with CoV-2, we consider the long-run ratios of sick reported individuals to the overall population a benchmark that allows us to judge the credibility of our predictions for Germany. We are aware that we compare very di¤erent countries with very di¤erent cultural and political habits and medical systems. For reference, we also look at a cross section of infections for European countries. See the appendix for a description of data sources. 6 Hubei Since the onset of the outbreak in the Hubei province in China, the number of con…rmed cases has risen dramatically, peaking at 67,801 (WHO Situation Reports, 2020). 7 Reporting began in January 2020 and we note that in mid-February, the WHO changed its classi…cation methodology by reporting both clinically and lab con…rmed cases rather than only lab con…rmed cases.

This di¤erence between the individual risk and aggregate outcomes is the result of a classic negative externality. Even individuals that take into account the overall risk of 7 in 100 to turn sick might not be concerned.

42386,Inclusive Costs of NPI Measures for COVID-19 Pandemic: Three Approaches,"Economic costs come from three sources: direct costs of illness and treatment, employment losses and losses due to falling demand or mandatory shutdowns. This approach is consistent with the standard approaches used to estimate economic costs of the epidemic Falling demand and mandatory shutdowns affect transport, food services, accommodation, arts and recreation. In the herd immunity approach, food services, arts and recreation shut down completely. Air transport loses 70% of output (note that about 15% of revenue in the US comes from mail and cargo) while ground transport and accommodation lose 50% of output for the duration of NPI measures (until May 2022). There are no mandatory shutdowns in the laissez-faire approach, but for peak infection month people avoid shopping in public places. For simplicity, we assume that the decrease in demand during the peak month of the epidemic (June 2020) is equal to the decrease in demand experienced due to social distancing measures in the herd immunity approach."

It is found that the latter can significantly reduce the percentage of people getting infected and the death toll. It is important to emphasize here that more testing has to be applied to individuals without symptoms, since those with symptoms contain themselves automatically in most cases. As improved testing capacities are built up, our approach may help to decide when alternative mitigation methods may not only complement, but eventually replace the current social distancing regime. This may help to minimize the socio-economical impacts resulting from severe social isolation policies. While social distancing is currently essential, it is of utmost importance that the testing capabilities are upgraded such that they cover large portions of affected populations in the near future."
42437,Modeling of COVID-19 Pandemic and Scenarios for Containment,"While the paper simulates various scenarios of containment, it does not address the economic cost of each scenario. In line with recent findings, the note argues that a fast and aggressive multi-layer intervention is needed to have a substantial dent of the transmission. What the paper calls for is a clear and transparent strategy by governments to implement social distancing and aggressive testing. The testing, should be targeted to geographic locations that the virus is wide spread, to airports and cruise ships, to road travellers, and anyone who has been in areas that are hot spot or has been in any contact with someone in affected locations over the past two weeks. The strategy should not ""just"" focus on those that show symptoms but should include ""all"" who might have been exposed. In this exceptional environment, governments can use temporarily a combination of location data and credit card information to track COVID-19 in their countries and use surveillance tools to monitor quarantined individuals."

Table 1 reports the number of death and recoveries at end-2020. Obviously, the combined set of policies, described in scenario v yields the best outcome with the lowest fatality and infected cases. Comparing scenario iii and iv, we conclude that a combined intensive testing, identifying infected individuals, and quarantine is a more effective policy than just a shelter-in-place policy. As discussed, scenario vi is the same as scenario v, assuming that the authorities end the shelterin-place policy 30-days after the peak of the pandemic. Unfortunately, under such scenario the death toll can be still multiplied by 4 times compared to the scenario where social interactions are just reduced and kept low by 50 percent. If the social interaction is increased to normal times, the death toll can be 15 times larger than in the scenario v. Many governments are impatient to open their countries businesses. They are rightly worried about the economic cost of a prolonged shutdown of economic activity. There are already outcry across countries by those who have lost their jobs. Many in low income and developing countries cannot afford to stay in home for long, since there are not enough safety nets to protect the most vulnerable. On the other hand, even in advanced economies, the ripple effect of a lengthy and uncertain shutdown of the economy is too painful. This is the reason that countries' authorities have to start implementing a broad range of decisive actions."

Unlike the current approach in some countries, where only the symptomatic cases are tested, the authorities should provide intensive and extensive testing and try to identify almost-all infected cases. This process would identify asymptomatic but infected cases and stop them of spreading the virus. This is key for a successful containment policy. Given the geographic distribution of the pandemic, the testing should focus on the most affected locations first and then expand to those people who have visited the hot spots or have been in contact with anyone in those areas, while everyone practice social distancing. A combination policy, as discussed above, not only reduces the number of infected, and ultimately the death toll, but it shorten the shelter-in-place period and consequently lowers the economic cost."

As of March 28, 2020, there have been more than 570000 confirmed cases and over 26000 deaths caused by COVID-19 worldwide 2 . Exacerbating the problem, there is no specific antiviral medication toward COVID-19, though development efforts are underway [3] [4] [5] [6] . Although vaccines are thought to be the most powerful weapon to fight against virus invasion, it may take quite a long time to develop and clinically test the safety of a vaccine. Moreover, vaccines are usually limited as preventative measures given to uninfected individuals. Thus, as an emergency measure, it is desirable to develop effective antiviral therapeutics that can take effect rapidly not only to treat COVID-19 and but also to prevent its further transmission."

Relatedly, a news article on Forbes provided some rough estimates on the potential benefits caused by city lockdown in China: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2020/03/16/coronavirus-lockdown-may-have-saved-77000-lives-in-china-just-from-pollution-reduction. hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak, and the Chinese government launched draconian countermeasures to prevent the escalation of the infections (Chen et al., 2020; Kucharski et al., 2020) . Nearly one-third of Chinese cities were locked down in a top-down manner, and various types of economic activities were strictly prohibited. In these cities, individuals were requested to stay at home, unnecessary commercial operations, private and public gatherings were suspended, transportations were largely banned (both within a city and across cities), mandatory temperature checking could be found in most public facilities. Second, China also suffers greatly from severe air pollution problems, with some estimates suggesting that air pollution is associated with an annual loss of nearly 25 million healthy life years (Kassebaum et al., 2014) . If city lockdown indeed significantly improved the air quality in China, the implied health benefits would be an order of magnitude larger than in countries with lower initial pollution levels."
42489,"COVID-19, City Lockdown, and Air Pollution: Evidence from China","Panel A shows that impact is much more significant in colder cities or ones located in the North. The estimated reduction in the AQI is around 20~30 points for those cities and is 0~10 points in warmer or Southern cities. The difference could be driven by the fact that colder cities consumed more coals for heating, and lockdown reduces such consumption in offices, plants, and schools, which eventually led to a greater improvement in air quality. In Panel B, we see the effect is greater in cities with larger GDP, population, and higher income (measured by per capita GDP). This is consistent with the fact that energy consumption is higher in more agglomerated economies, where a lot of economic activities take place. Finally, Panels C and D show that in the cities that rely more on industrial activities (measured by the manufacturing output, the volume of traffic, the number of firms, and the emissions of different types of pollutants), the effect is more substantial.

42492,Perception of emergent epidemic of COVID-2019 / SARS CoV-2 on the Polish Internet,"In order to prepare and manage the crisis in an optimal way, a deeper perception analysis in the form of reliable quantitative and qualitative analysis is required. Especially, according to the results of empirical research (Taranowicz [46] ), society expects institutional activities and in the event of an epidemic, it is the ""state (...) that is responsible for the poor health of the population"". Perhaps one of the reasons the Chinese have been so successful in controlling the spread of the infection is that social media like Wechat (Wang et al. [47] , Zhang et al. [48] ), or Internet forums (Liu and Lu [49] ) were analyzed by algorithms (Lu et al. [50] , Paul and Dredze [51] , Salathe et al. [52] ) with a goal to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Combining the behavior changes detected via social media analysis with the detailed information on human mobility via e.g. mobile phone tracking (Schneider et al. [53] ), sophisticated computational models of infectious disease spread could be implemented (Belik et al. [54] , Vespignani [55] ) allowing to simulate various scenarios and assess possible human and economic losses. Furthermore, impact of public information campaigns could be measured by internal surveys of public opinion. In addition, Internet media analysis could fill gaps in socio-medical research on collective actions during an important public health disruption event such as infectious diseases.

42514,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"(3) those affected may be contagious during a prolonged asymptomatic incubation period, and many never develop symptoms distinctive from a mild flu, making it difficult to identify and isolate the infected before they pass the virus to others. (4) Broad public mandates for social distancing are also vital to help manage a key multiplier of COVID-19 fatality rates: a substantial fraction of patients require lengthy (on average 8 bed days) intensive care unit (ICU) support to survive acute respiratory distress, and uncontrolled spread of the disease is expected to generate at its peak far greater demand for ICU care than existing capacity can meet.(5; 2; 6) Public health experts have pleaded with officials to quickly mandate social distancing to flatten the curve of coronavirus infections -that is, reduce the peak caseload -before exponential case growth leads to hundreds of thousands or millions of deaths. In particular, it is important to keep peak levels low to prevent the fatality rate from rising to the levels seen in areas where hospitals are overwhelmed with cases. (7) In the United States, the emergence of the coronavirus has created a natural experiment in which elected officials face incredibly urgent and far-reaching policy decisions for which they typically have no personal experience or expertise, and for which the history of policy examples is either mere days old, or so dated as to be largely unknown except by public health experts. The most significant policy decisions of this kindboth in terms of their potential to mitigate the epidemic and their economic consequences -are mandates for social distancing through restrictions on public gatherings; closure or restriction of schools, restaurants, and other non-essential businesses; and orders for the public to stay at home. (8) Under the federal and state constitutions, the key actions fall to executives, and particularly to governors, whose powers in public health emergencies are typically singular and extensive."
42514,Pandemic Politics: Timing State-Level Social Distancing Responses to COVID-19,"Evidence from the 1918 influenza pandemic underscores the stakes for elected officials. In that earlier natural experiment, American cities faced similar decisions regarding social distancing policies. For example, Philadelphia decided to hold a parade welcoming soldiers returning from World War I, while St. Louis cancelled its parade, and ultimately experienced one eighth as many deaths per capita during that wave of influenza. The height of the infection in Saint Louis was two months later than in Philadelphia, and was far lower, with deaths peaking at fifty per hundred thousand rather than 250 per hundred thousand.(11; 12) Shortly after community transmission of the coronavirus was discovered in Washington and California in late February 2020, public health experts drew the comparison between Philadelphia and Saint Louis, hoping to inspire policymakers to promote social distancing. Nevertheless, in an echo of the decisions made a century before, there are significant differences in the timing of governors' decisions to mandate social distancing. For instance, on 6 March 2020, after Kentucky had its first confirmed case of COVID-19, Governor Andy Beshear (D) immediately called a state of emergency, encouraged social distancing, and closed bars and restaurants ten days later. But when neighboring Tennesse uncovered its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 5th, Governor Bill Lee (R) waited until 12 March to declare a state of emergency and finally closed restaurants and bars on 22 March. (13) Why did governors' responses to a sudden, shared threat differ? Under normal circumstances, governors' policy decisions are shaped by the national leaders and agenda of their political party and the demands of their own constituents, particularly those in their partisan base. Governors may also look to innovative peers and neighbors for examples to follow. But the fast-moving nature of the coronavirus threat, the need to rely on experts to understand complex scientific material, and uncertainty about the nature and scope of the threat might scramble all or some of these usual motivations. pandemic politics · Adolph, Amano, Bang-Jensen, Fullman & Wilkerson The public health case for mandatory social distancing in the United States developed quickly in the wake of the first reports of community transmission on 26 February in Washington state. One might expect social distancing measures to quickly follow across the fifty states, perhaps more quickly in states with greater number of confirmed cases. But mandating social distancing is a difficult decision for any political leader. If these measures are successful in preventing widespread mortality, many members of the public who suffered the costs of these mandates may never fully comprehend the benefits. Indeed, the more successful the intervention, the more likely it will appear to many as an ""overreaction."" Moreover, some states faced higher potential costs from these policies: closing schools is more painful in states where more children depend on schools for subsidized lunches and shutting restaurants and public places is more difficult in states highly dependent on tourism. (14) More generally, states with more limited economic resources are likely far less able to weather the deprivations caused by economic shutdowns, or to expand social insurance protections during mandated social distancing, and thus may be considerably more reluctant to take these steps."

This might explain Louisiana's relatively slow adoption of social distancing policies despite a confirmed outbreak and a Democratic governor. Social distancing delays due to limited state economic resources are particularly troubling, as poorer states may also have larger vulnerable populations and more fragile health systems."
42523,Global versus focused isolation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-A cost-effectiveness analysis,"However, a few countries, such as South Korea, have succeeded in slowing the rate of infections without economically damaging lockdowns.

However, global adoption of these extreme measures is implicated in unprecedented social and economic costs that might, directly and indirectly, affect the health system, among many other aspects of our life, in the years to come.

42884,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"The above improvements in the healthcare sector can only be achieved if different smart city products are fashioned to support standardized protocols that would allow for seamless communication between themselves. Weber and Podnar Žarko [9] suggest that IoT devices in use should support open protocols, and at the same time, the device provider should ensure that those fashioned uphold data integrity and safety during communication and transmission. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, as Vermesan and Friess [10] explain, most smart city products use proprietary solutions that are only understood by the service providers. This situation often creates unnecessary fragmentation of information rendering only a partial integrated view on the dynamics of the urban realm. With restricted knowledge on emergent trends, urban managers cannot effectively take decisions to contain outbreaks and adequately act without compromising the social and economic integrity of their city. This paper, inspired by the case of the COVID-19 virus, explores how urban resilience can be further achieved, and outlines the importance of seeking standardization of communication across and between smart cities."
42884,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"While the significance of such data in advancing efficiency, productivity and processes in different sectors is being lauded, there are criticisms arising as to the nature of data collection, storage, management and accessibility by only a small group of users. The latter particularly includes select ICT corporations that are also located in specific geographies [6, [14] [15] [16] [17] . These criticisms are justified, as in recent years, big data is seen as the new 'gold rush' of the 21st century and limiting its access means higher economic returns and increased influence and control at various scales to those who control data. These associated benefits with big data are clearly influencing geopolitical standings, in both corporate and conventional governance realms, and there is increased competition between powerful economies to ensure that they have the maximum control of big data. As case in point is the amount of 'push and pull' that has arisen from Huawei's 5G internet planned rollout [18] . Though the latter service offers unprecedented opportunities to increase internet speeds, and thereby influence the handling of big data, countries like the U.S. and some European countries that are key proponents and players in global political, economic and health landscapes, are against this rollout, arguing that it is a deceptive way of gathering private data under the guise of espionage. On this, it has been noted that the issue of data control and handling by a few corporations accords with their principles of nationalism, and that these work for their own wellbeing as well as to benefit the territories they are registered in. Therefore, geopolitical issues are expected on the technological front as most large data-rich corporations are located in powerful countries that have influence both economically, health-wise and politically [19] [20] [21] . Such are deemed prized tokens on the international landscape, and it is expected that these economies will continue to work towards their predominant control as much as possible. On the health sector, the same approach is being upheld where critical information and data are not freely shared between economies as that would be seen to be benefiting other in-competition economies, whereas different economies would cherish the maximization of benefits from such data collections."
42884,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"The outbreak of any disease has significant impacts on local economies across the globe. For instance, when SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) (SARS-CoV) broke in China in 2002, it was estimated, that the Asian region incurred tremendous negative impacts socially, health-wise and economically, potentially amounting to Asian regional economy losses of between USD $12-18 billion from tourism, travel and retail sales industries alone [27] . The Zika virus outbreak, spread by daytime-active Aedes mosquitoes, is estimated to have cost equator-belt local economies in affected areas between USD $7 and USD $18 billion [28] . The Ebola virus (or Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF)) caused an estimated loss of USD $2.2 billion in GDP in three West African economies (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) in 2015 alone [29] . In regard to the current epidemic of Coronavirus, though it is too early to quantify or project its impacts on the global economy, there are fears that it may take the precedent of other outbreaks where billions of dollars will be lost. The foundations for this escalating loss can be witnessed in the rapid growth of travel bans being enacted by some countries and their international airports, especially specifically restricting people from visiting the affected regions in China and their growth into general non-Chinese travel movements. On this, noting that the outbreak came almost on the eve of the Lunar New Year celebrations, and that it had been estimated that over 400 million people were expected to travel in different parts of the world and China to observe this festivity, the majority have had to reconsider their options as to flights, hotels and entertainment events due to service provider cancellations [30] . Those who had already booked their flights are expected to receive their refunds following the directive by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, however, this move has already affected the share value of Chinese airline companies [30] ."
42884,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"The above impacts demonstrate that the issues of virus outbreaks transcend urban safety and impacts upon all other facets of our urban fabric. Therefore, it becomes paramount to ensure that the measures taken to contain a virus transcend nationalist agendas where data and information sharing is normally restricted, to a more global agenda where humanity and global order are encouraged. With such an approach, it would be easier to share urban health data across geographies to better monitor emerging health threats in order to provide more economic stability, thereby ensuring no disruptions on such sectors like tourism and travel industries, amongst others. This is possible by ensuring collaborative, proactive measures to control outbreak spread and thus, human movements. This would remove fears on travelers, and would have positive impacts upon the tourism industry, that has been seen to bear the economic brunt whenever such outbreaks occur. This can be achieved by ensuring that protocols on data sharing are calibrated to remove all hurdles pertaining to sharing of information. On this, Lawpoolsri et al. [31] posits that such issues, like transparency, timelessness of sharing and access and quality of data, should be upheld so that continuous monitoring and assessment can be pursued."
42884,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"However, despite the indisputable roles that installed devices play in providing relevant health information, their data communication aspect needs to be reviewed. First, communications are seen to be geography-restricted (restricted to a given location), such that they seldom expand or communicate with their like, installed beyond their restricted areas. Secondly, these devices are usually sourced and installed by separate corporations that maintain unique and specific standards for data processing and sharing, and accordingly, tying cities to the sole usage of their product(s). Such strategies are adopted as private corporations try to maximize their economic gains, since the digital solution market is a lucrative one and is expected to continue growing and expanding [6, 7] ."
42884,On the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak and the Smart City Network: Universal Data Sharing Standards Coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Benefit Urban Health Monitoring and Management,"With scenarios like the present Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, that not only impacts upon the economic status of cities, but also affects their social standing, it becomes imperative to emphasize the adoption of universal standards for data sharing. Such a move could have far reaching impact across cities and territories especially in positively combating outbreaks and disasters in a quicker, safer and standardized way, such that when the cure is discovered, the results can be replicated in various parts of the globe. With a collaborated data sharing protocol, it would be possible to have a larger dataset resulting in increased processing capabilities especially with technologies that are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Through this way, as noted by Jiang et al. [36] and Allam [37] , it would be possible to facilitate early detection, achieve better diagnosis and provide better urban management decisions for increased efficiency for virus containment."
44136,Virulence factors in porcine coronaviruses and vaccine design,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with a positivesense RNA genome that belong to the Coronaviridae family within the Nidovirales order (de Groot et al., 2012) . CoVs are the causative agents of a variety of human and animal diseases. In animals, CoVs cause life-threatening diseases, such as severe enteric and respiratory tract infections, and are economically relevant pathogens (Perlman and Netland, 2009) . Acute infectious diarrhea is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality in piglets worldwide. Enteric infections in animals are frequently associated with viruses, including rotaviruses and CoVs (Chattha et al., 2015) . A metagenomics analysis of diarrheic and healthy samples from China in 2012 found porcine CoVs in 77% of the diarrheic samples, and only in around 7% of the healthy samples, highlighting the potential importance of CoVs as enteric porcine pathogens ."
44385,Association of seropositivity for influenza and coronaviruses with history of mood disorders and suicide attempts,"Our study has a number of limitations that would have to be better addressed in future projects. The first limitation relates to the cross sectional nature of the study. Data collection was carried out at one time point and therefore it is not clear whether influenza or coronavirus infection occurred before, after, or during the onset of the depressive episodes. Consequently, the direction of causality cannot be inferred. Second, possible mediators and confounders such as socioeconomic factors, inflammatory markers, and patients' axis II psychopathology were not assessed. For participants with history of mood disorder, the number of depressive episodes, hospitalizations, age of onset, presence of rapid cycling, comorbid bulimia and cyclothymic temperament (Azorin et al., 2009) were not assessed. In addition, the relatively small sample size makes adjustment for all these potential confounders impractical."
44629,Urbanization and the dynamics of RNA viruses in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos),"Influenza A virus (IAV) is a multi-host virus, wherein spillover between birds, humans and agricultural animals does occur, and dabbling ducks, such as those found in city parks, constitute the main reservoir host for these viruses (Olsen et al., 2006; Webster et al., 1992) . Indeed, highly urbanized areas may contain canals and large city parks with ponds housing a wide variety of wild and semi-domestic birds. RNA viruses such as IAV have a low pathogenicity phenotype in their natural hosts (Olsen et al., 2006) , but have large negative socioeconomic consequences when they spillover into food production animals and humans (Alexander and Brown, 2009; FAO, 2005 FAO, , 2012 . For example, the most recent remerging highly pathogenic IAV H5N8, which was transported globally by waterfowl, resulted in the culling of hundreds of thousands of chickens and turkeys, and is a risk to human health given the reassortment potential (European Food Safety Authority, 2014; Lee et al., 2014; Pasick et al., 2015; Verhagen et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2014) . Dabbling ducks are a host for a number of RNA viruses, including avian coronavirus [CoV] , avian paramyxovirus type 1 [APMV-1], and emerging evidence suggests they may also be hosts for an array of avian astroviruses [AstroV] (e.g. Chu et al., 2012; Ramey et al., 2013; Tolf et al., 2013b; Wille et al., 2015; Wille et al., 2016b) . These viruses do not cause signs of disease in their wildlife hosts, but have closely related forms causing morbidity and mortality in poultry, such as infectious bronchitis (CoV) (e.g. Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2014; Jackwood et al., 2012; Zhuang et al., 2015) , Newcastle disease (APMV-1) (e.g. Alexander, 2011; Jindal et al., 2009; Ramey et al., 2013; Snoeck et al., 2013; Tolf et al., 2013b) , duck hepatitis (AstroV) or avian nephritis (AstroV) (e.g. Chu et al., 2012; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011) . These viruses have been assessed, to various degrees, in wild migrating waterfowl. In Sweden, and globally, the ecology of IAV is well described in wild waterfowl, where up to 30% of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) are infected during the autumn migration (Latorre-Margalef et al., 2014; Olsen et al., 2006) . Recent studies have been instrumental in starting to describe dynamics and ecology of AMPV-1 and CoV in wild birds; 9-12% of migrating Mallards have CoV infections, compared to a lower prevalence (2%) of AMPV-1 towards the end of the migratory season in Sweden (Tolf et al., 2013b; Wille et al., 2015) . Most APMV-1 is detected during IAV studies where agglutinating agents are detected after culture that are not IAV (e.g. Jindal et al., 2009; Ramey et al., 2013) , so few true prevalence estimates exist. Beyond these viruses, we have a limited understanding of the virodiversity in waterfowl; astroviruses for example have only recently been assessed in wild birds, and the results of a single study suggest that waterfowl may be important in the epidemiology of these viruses (Chu et al., 2012) . Given that waterfowl are hosts for both multi-host viruses and viruses that cause morbidity and mortality in food production birds, combined with the increased contact between waterfowl and humans in urban areas, dynamics of these viruses in urban bird populations should be explored."
44629,Urbanization and the dynamics of RNA viruses in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos),"While IAV has been intensively assessed, we are only starting to explore dynamics of other avian RNA viruses. Indeed, this is the first intraannual dataset exploring dynamics of CoV, APMV-1 and AstroV and, furthermore, the first comparison between wild and urban settings for CoV and APMV-1. It is also the second study assessing AstroV in wild birds (Chu et al., 2012) . Given the economic implications of these viruses, our limited understanding of the dynamics and ecology of these viruses in wild birds is disquieting. Perhaps unsurprising, overall annual trends in prevalence were similar for all viruses, and shared ecological drivers, such as those identified for IAV (van Dijk et al., 2014) , are the most parsimonious explanation for the shared patterns in long term dynamics of these viruses. That is, increased prevalence due to input of immunologically naïve birds into the system after breeding and aggregating of birds for autumn migration, and decreased prevalence in the winter following an increase in herd immunity (Latorre-Margalef et al., 2014; Olsen et al., 2006; van Dijk et al., 2014) . This dataset provides further evidence of the importance of waterfowl, urban or wild, in the epidemiology of CoV and APMV-1. It is only within the last 10 years that CoV have been assessed in wild birds and these viruses have largely been assessed using single time point studies, across a range of species, and using an array of different screening methods (e.g. Chu et al., 2011; Muradrasoli et al., 2010; Wille et al., 2016b) . Given the long history of APMV-1 research (Alexander et al., 2012) , and ""accidental"" isolation of this virus in IAV studies (e.g. Jindal et al., 2009; Ramey et al., 2013) , it is known that these viruses are present in waterfowl, however accurate prevalence estimates are still rare (Tolf et al., 2013b; Wille et al., 2015) . Not all economically relevant avian RNA viruses have been assessed in wild birds, and astroviruses are such an example. Most strikingly, in this population, AstroV might be more pervasive than IAV, which has long been thought to be one of the most important RNA viruses in wild waterfowl. Not only was prevalence of AstroV higher than IAV, viruses were detected over a longer temporal interval. These viruses are particularly interesting due to the importance in poultry including chickens, turkeys and ducks, but the overall lack of assessment in wild birds leads to limited understanding of the epidemiology and ecology beyond food production birds. Furthermore, this study corroborates Chu et al. (2012) in that wild birds appear to contribute to the epidemiology of chicken or turkey ""adapted"" astrovirus strains."
44629,Urbanization and the dynamics of RNA viruses in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos),"This study highlights our limited understanding of RNA virus dynamics in birds in general, and more specifically, viruses in Mallards. Mallards are one of the most common avian species on the planet, which is owed to the fact that they are able to adapt to environments disturbed by human activities, and are a common sight in many cities (Cramp and Simmons, 1977; Drilling et al., 2002) . Mallards and other dabbling ducks are the natural reservoir for IAV, are known to harbour high prevalence of IAV in the wild, and may be implicated in the spread of highly pathogenic IAV (Latorre-Margalef et al., 2014; van Dijk et al., 2015; Verhagen et al., 2015) . Indeed, the H1N1 IAV isolated in this study was more similar to viruses isolated in Asia than Europe suggesting long distance dispersal prior to circulation in this urban duck pond. This study was undertaken in 2014, prior to the influx of highly pathogenic H5N8 which were carried by apparently healthy birds (Verhagen et al., 2015) . Given these urban Mallards harbour ""Asian"" IAV there is certainly concern for zoonotic spillover. Furthermore, it is not a stretch to imagine that Mallards may also be reservoirs and important in the spread and dynamics of other economically relevant RNA viruses such as CoV, APMV-1, and AstroV. Of all pathogens, RNA viruses are the most likely to be zoonotic (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005) , and it is in environments where humans are in close proximity to a high density of birds that zoonotic spillover is most likely to occur. For example, live-bird markets are central in the transmission of avian influenza viruses from birds to humans (Wan et al., 2011) . The role of urban ducks, given low virus prevalence, is uncertain, however, to better understand the zoonotic risk a better understanding of the RNA virus diversity and wildlife-pathogen dynamics in urban landscapes is crucial."
44732,"Potential scenarios for the progression of a COVID-19 epidemic in the European Union and the European Economic Area, March 2020","Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely. We provide scenarios for use in preparedness for a possible widespread epidemic. The EU/EEA is moving towards the 'limited sustained transmission' phase. We propose actions to prepare for potential mitigation phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of citizens."
44732,"Potential scenarios for the progression of a COVID-19 epidemic in the European Union and the European Economic Area, March 2020",The aim of this paper was to provide a general scenario planning framework that can be used by European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries in preparation for a possible widespread epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
44732,"Potential scenarios for the progression of a COVID-19 epidemic in the European Union and the European Economic Area, March 2020","• Large outbreaks now taking place outside of China increase the rate of importation into and within the EU/EEA, challenging the containment strategy currently in place. • Some countries are reporting fewer importations than would be inferred from travel volumes, suggesting that circulation of the virus is more widespread than it appears from case detection and a pandemic may occur sooner than expected [9] . • Globalisation of trade and frequent international travel will facilitate the spread of the virus. • Vaccines and antiviral treatments are under development but may not be widely available for several months or even years. • The outbreak could cause substantial social, political and economic disruption also in parts of the world not directly affected by the virus."
44779,Assessing the Impact of Reduced Travel on Exportation Dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19),"Although the COVID-19 epidemic was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO), the WHO specifically called upon member states to not restrict the freedom of movement of persons as a result of the epidemic [22] . However, member states did not adhere to this recommendation and have varyingly restricted the free movement of people from China [23] . Such restrictions were most drastic in China, where some cities were put on complete lockdown [23] . These political decisions regarding movement restrictions must balance the expected epidemiological impact with predicted economic burden-the latter of which we did not examine. While securing a few days delay to epidemic spread in China would secure time for healthcare systems in Chinese cities that have not yet been affected to prepare for the appearance of case-patients [21] , the impact of such a delay outside China is not substantial enough to accomplish meaningful prevention, such as the development, manufacturing, and distribution of a vaccine."
44792,Antigenicity and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV S protein receptor-binding domain stably expressed in CHO cells,"The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein contains multiple conformation-dependent epitopes that induce neutralizing antibody responses. Here we used CHO-K1 cells to establish a cell line for stable expression of a 193-mer (residues 318-510) RBD (RBD193-CHO) and determined its antigenicity and immunogenicity. We found that RBD193-CHO reacted strongly with a panel of six monoclonal antibodies recognizing various conformational and linear epitopes in RBD, suggesting that this recombinant protein maintains intact conformation and good antigenicity. Immunization of mice with RBD193-CHO resulted in induction of high titers of RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies and potent IL-4-expressing T cell responses. RBD193-CHO induced immunity that protected a majority of the vaccinated mice from SARS-CoV challenge. These results suggest that the recombinant RBD produced in an established stable cell line maintains strong immunogenicity with high potential for use as an effective and economic subunit SARS vaccine."
44792,Antigenicity and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV S protein receptor-binding domain stably expressed in CHO cells,"The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 led to severe health and economic consequences worldwide. To prevent the re-emergence of this infectious disease from potential animal reservoirs [1] [2] [3] , it is necessary to develop effective vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the causative agent of SARS [4, 5] . Compared with other antiviral strategies, vaccines, particularly those based on the spike (S) protein, demonstrate greater efficacy in the prevention of SARS [6] . The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S protein contains multiple conformational-dependent epitopes that induce potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV infection [7, 8] , suggesting an attractive target for development of SARS vaccine. Therefore, establishment of an approach for producing large quantity of recombinant RBD with appropriate antigenicity and immunogenicity is needed."
44792,Antigenicity and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV S protein receptor-binding domain stably expressed in CHO cells,"The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line has been widely used to express recombinant proteins and biopharmaceutical products in a stable and large-scale manner. As such, the selected CHO-K1 stable cell lines have been established to express persistently recombinant secreted proteins, such as dust mite allergen, Blo t 5 [9] , human MUC1 mucin [10] and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) [11] . Furthermore, when adapted to serum-free medium, recombinant proteins can be highly expressed in suspension cul-ture, making it possible to purify proteins from the suspension in large quantity [9] . Proteins obtained in this way have been shown to maintain biological activity and proper conformation [9, 11] . Therefore, the successful expression and purification of a number of recombinant proteins in CHO-K1 cells provides a rational basis for developing effective and economic subunit SARS vaccines by continuous production of recombinant proteins containing the functional domains of SARS-CoV S protein. Based on this reasoning, the present study aimed to express a 193-mer (residues 318-510) recombinant RBD of SARS-CoV S protein (RBD193-CHO) in an established stable CHO-K1 cell line and further determine its antigenicity, immunogenicity and protective immunity in a mouse model."
44792,Antigenicity and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV S protein receptor-binding domain stably expressed in CHO cells,"We have previously shown that the recombinant RBD of SARS-CoV S protein expressed in 293T cells could induce highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and protective immunity in immunized mice, suggesting that it could be developed as an effective and safe SARS subunit vaccine for the prevention of SARS-CoV infection [6, 25] . However, to obtain highly expressed RBD protein with biological functions in a convenient and economic way, we sought to establish a stable cell line for long-term and high volume production of the recombinant RBD. Therefore, CHO-K1 cells, rather than 293T cells, were selected because CHO-K1 cells have the ability to express the protein of interest persistently at a high level [22, 26, 27] . Based on this rationale, the plasmid for transient expression of a 193-amino acid (residues 318-510) RBD (RBD193-CHO) of SARS-CoV S protein in CHO-K1 cells was constructed first. The purified protein was characterized, and its function was confirmed. Then, a stable CHO-K1 cell line was successfully established, and it was demonstrated that this cell line could highly and persistently express RBD193-CHO protein in the culture supernatant of conditioned medium (Fig. 1A) . The purified protein was proven to exhibit good antigenicity since it significantly reacted with five of six mAbs that recognize the conformational epitopes in RBD and one mAb specific for the linear RBD epitope (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that RBD193-CHO protein maintains intact conformation. The analysis of the immunogenicity of RBD193-CHO protein in the mouse model indicated that the expressed protein induced potent RBD-specific antibody responses with neutralizing antibody activity (Fig. 2) and strong T cell immune responses (Fig. 3) ."

Educational attainment was classified into five levels (less than middle school, high school, university, graduate school or higher). Educational attainment was investigated in all surveys except survey 1. Occupation was classified as either unemployed, farming and fishery, self-employed, blue-collar worker, white-collar worker, fulltime housewife, or student. Perceived household economic status was classified into five levels (lower, lower middle, middle, upper middle, upper). Respondents were classified as either metropolitan or non-metropolitan residents; and distinguished by whether they resided in an area where MERS had occurred or not. Party identification was classified based on the support for the president or the political parties. Support or lack of support for the president was assessed using the options of ""approval"", ""disapproval"", or ""no opinion"", while support for the party identification was assessed based on alignment either with the ruling party, with the opposition party, or no opinion."

There were no statistically significant differences between surveys.

Majority of the participants were employed, were in the middle economic status, metropolitan, without societal-level risk perception (controlled). Figure 1 reports how the outbreak proceeded, with three overlapping transmission periods, the timing of the five independent surveys, and the risk perception rates. Noticeable differences were investigated between personal-level and societal-level risk proportions throughout the epidemic periods. Overall risk perception at personal-level proportion (56.5%) was nearly two times higher than at societal-level (30.3%). Personal-level risk perception proportions were always higher than societal-level during the present study periods.

Since the initial description of the disease, several other syndromes, including renal disease, proventricular disease and egg malformations, have been associated with this virus. Furthermore, over 20 serotypes of IBV are now recognized, with several circulating in the USA at any one time. Massachusetts, Connecticut and California serotypes are currently of the greatest economic importance (Cavenagh and Naqi, 2003) .

45735,"Expression of the C-type lectins DC-SIGN or L-SIGN alters host cell susceptibility for the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus","Infectious bronchitis virus is the type species of the family Coronaviridae, and is part of the Gammacoronavirus genus (Woo et al., 2009) . Within the Coronaviridae, individual species are able to infect a wide array of animals, including but not limited to humans, dogs, cats, pigs, cows, birds, bats, and whales. IBV mainly infects chickens, and globally causes great economic loss for the poultry industry every year (Saif, 2003) . Although IBV mainly infects the ciliated epithelia in the respiratory tract of chickens and causes respiratory disease, many studies have discovered that IBV can also spread to other organs of the chicken and can cause pathology in other issues, such as alimentary tract, testes, oviduct, and Harderian gland (Bezuidenhout et al., 2011; Raj and Jones, 1997) . Clinical signs include coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, loss of appetite, and reduction in egg laying (Saif, 2003) . In addition to the original Massachusetts serotype, dozens of serotypes and genotypes of IBV have now been detected (Meir et al., 2010) . Many strains can cause major or minor nephritis in both naturally infected or experimentally infected chickens (Lambrechts et al., 1993) ."
45842,Surveillance for emerging respiratory viruses,"The emergence of new human viral diseases aff ecting the respiratory tract continues to threaten global public health security. On March 12, 2003, WHO issued a global alert for an emerging and yet unknown illness that was subsequently known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 1 SARS-CoV caused more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths in over 30 countries with a substantial economic impact. 2 Since then, several other viral respiratory pathogens (table 1) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] have emerged including avian infl uenza (H5N1, H7N9, H10N8), variant infl uenza A H3N2 virus, human adenovirus-14, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Soon after the discovery of SARS, additional coronaviruses were also identifi ed: corona virus NL63 and coronavirus HKU1. 3, 4 Most infl uenza A epidemics occur in January, February, and March. However, outbreaks of infl uenza A Beijing/32/92 H3N2 in 1993 and Fujian/411/2002 H3N2 in 2003 happened in November and December. 20 In an analysis of 335 emerging infectious diseases from 1940 to 2004, most (60%) were zoonoses and 25% were viruses, and the study showed an increase in events over time. 21 In this Series paper, we review worldwide active surveillance systems for emerging and re-emerging respiratory viruses. We identify the rapid and early identifi cation systems to allow early control measures to be put in place to prevent the spread of these pathogens. We also review the work of WHO Global Infl uenza Surveillance Network (GISN), Global Infl uenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), and the network of national infl uenza centres and laboratories."

On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as being a novel coronavirus now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . Since, the illness resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease . Evidence to date is that ca 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover [1] . In ca 14% cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospitalisation while the remaining 6% cases experience critical illness requiring intensive care. The mortality of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 is ca 4% [1] . In this study, we assess the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them to that of Hubei Province, China. We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy during 31 January-15 March 2020."
46025,"Newly emerged porcine enteric alphacoronavirus in southern China: Identification, origin and evolutionary history analysis","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, they belong to the family Coronaviridae, and they are found in a wide variety of animals in which they can cause respiratory, hepatic, enteric and neurological diseases of varying severity (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005; Woo et al., 2006) . CoVs are separated into four distinct genera based on genotypic and serological characterization: alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV (Su et al., 2016) . To date, several enteric CoVs that are attributed to diarrhea in swine have been identified and have caused substantial economic losses. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) belong to alpha-CoV, and both of them cause life-threatening acute enteric disease in suckling piglets (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Zhang et al., 2017) . Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a beta-CoV that primarily affects pigs under 3 weeks of age (Pensaert and Callebaut, 1974; Rho et al., 2011) ."
46025,"Newly emerged porcine enteric alphacoronavirus in southern China: Identification, origin and evolutionary history analysis","Coronaviruses are important pathogens that have a wide host range and cause different kinds of diseases in a variety of animals; many novel coronaviruses have been identified in both humans and animals since the outbreak of SARS in 2003 (Fouchier et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2005 Lau et al., , 2007 Wang et al., 2014b; Woo et al., 2005 Woo et al., , 2012 Zaki et al., 2012) .

In particular, largescale outbreaks of PEDV in China and the USA, with high rates of illness and death in suckling piglets, caused substantial economic losses in late 2010 and 2013, respectively Wang et al., 2013) ."
46438,SARS-CoV-2 is an appropriate name for the new coronavirus,"We have read with great interest the Correspondence by Shibo Jiang and colleagues, 1 in which they propose a name change for the newly emerged coronavirus, 2 which was recently designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. 3 The authors argued that the use of SARS in the virus name could confuse the public about the disease that it causes; in addition, they noted that the name SARS-CoV-2 is not consistent with the disease name chosen by WHO, coronavirus disease 2019. The authors also indicated that scientifically, SARS-CoV-2 is naturally occurring and different from other SARS-like or SARS-related coronaviruses that are mainly characterised by their genome sequences. Furthermore, given the probability of future attenuation of this virus to a low-pathogenic form, the authors predict that the use of the name SARS-CoV-2 might have adverse effects, both socially and economically. On these grounds, the authors suggest that the name of the new virus is changed to human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19). Although these concerns and suggestions are appreciated, we feel that the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 by the Coronavirus Study Group was appropriate."
46438,SARS-CoV-2 is an appropriate name for the new coronavirus,"We also believe that the use of the name SARS-CoV-2 will not affect social stability and economic development in the affected countries, as the authors envision. Given that the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is currently not well understood, and no effec t ive approach to stop such zoonotic transmission has been established, SARS-related coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 (or even SARS-CoV-3 in the future), might continue to emerge and reemerge. This has been exemplified in the transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, in which multiple spillover events occurred from camels to humans, resulting in human infec tions. 6 Thus, keeping SARS in the names of viruses of that species would be beneficial to keep the general public vigilant and prepared to respond quickly in the event of a new viral emergence.

We assessed the required expertise and capacity for molecular detection of 2019-nCoV in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries. Thirty-eight laboratories in 24 EU/EEA countries had diagnostic tests available by 29 January 2020. A coverage of all EU/EEA countries was expected by mid-February. Availability of primers/probes, positive controls and personnel were main implementation barriers."
46674,"Laboratory readiness and response for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in expert laboratories in 30 EU/EEA countries, January 2020","In early January 2020, it became evident that a new pathogenic human coronavirus, provisionally named novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), had emerged in China [1, 2] . The virus is causing an outbreak, which started in the metropole Wuhan, but was seeded through travellers across China with ongoing secondary chains of transmission in a wider geographical area. As at 10 February 2020, 40,553 confirmed cases including 910 deaths have been reported worldwide with an increasing number of cases being reported in Europe [3] . So far, instances of secondary spread from international travellers have been limited, but clusters of human-tohuman transmission have been reported involving persons with close contact to confirmed cases [4] . A key knowledge gap is the efficiency of community transmission of 2019-nCoV, including the contribution of mild or asymptomatic cases. On 30 January 2020, the Word Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) because of these uncertainties, the ongoing seeding of the virus internationally, and the need for preparedness across the world in order to track and control the epidemic. WHO highlighted the crucial role of early detection of cases to interrupt virus spread and emphasised that countries need to put in place strong measures to detect and laboratory-confirm cases early [5] . Here, we assessed the required expertise and diagnostic capacity in specialised laboratories in 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries."
46742,A genome-wide association study identifies major loci affecting the immune response against infectious bronchitis virus in chicken,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to the gamma-CoVs. Infectious bronchitis (IB), which is caused by IBV, was first reported in the United States in the 1930s (Cavanagh, 2007) . IB began as a disease of young birds, but as time progressed, the disease spread to older birds worldwide (Sjaak et al., 2011) . IBV can cause a severe respiratory viral disease of chickens and shows high mortality. IBV can also replicate in some epithelial cells of the gut, kidney and oviduct, resulting in poor weight gain in broilers, and serious egg yield drop and poor egg quality in layers and breeders (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2000; Cavanagh, 2001 Cavanagh, , 2007 . Thus, IB has a significant economic impact on the modern poultry industry. In addition, the CoV causing SARS most likely recombined genomic sequences from mammalian-like and avian-like CoVs (e.g. IBV), according to the molecular genetic data (Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004) . The impact of SARS on public health has led to the epidemiology of IB receiving much attention in many countries (Bourogaa et al., 2009; Pohuang et al., 2009; Rimondi et al., 2009; Kulkarni and Resurreccion, 2010; Villarreal et al., 2010; Chacon et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2011; Abdel-Moneim et al., 2012; Acevedo et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2012a,b) . Studying IBV alone to develop IB vaccines is insufficient to control IB outbreaks because IBV is highly variable (Sjaak et al., 2011) . Viruses and hosts show coevolution, so increasing our knowledge of host responses against IBV is helpful to protect the poultry industry from IB. However, there are few studies of the host responses against IBV, especially their genetic basis."
46817,Associations between bovine coronavirus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus infections and animal performance in Swedish dairy herds,"According to this study, BRSV infection had a large significant effect on milk yield and SCC and to some extent on reproduction performance of cows and survival of young stock. However, for the latter, the relationships found here should be confirmed in a larger study. The quantitative estimates of production effects associated with this infection will be useful information to assess its economic impact, as well as the profitability of control schemes that could be implemented on farms. In contrast, BCV infection, identified here based on either the dynamics of BCV-specific antibody levels over time or the occurrence of a presumably related outbreak, was not significantly associated with any production losses in cows from the infected herds com-pared with those in the FREE herds. These findings were unexpected because severe decrease in milk yield in cows with winter dysentery, as well as increased calf mortality, were identified in previous descriptions of outbreaks. Because the consequences on performances associated with BCV-related outbreaks are probably of short duration in most situations, case-control investigations relying on very reliable identification and dating of the BCV-related outbreak and of the corresponding period-at-risk, and targeting daily performance records would be a profitable area of research."
47082,Effects of operational decisions on the diffusion of epidemic disease: A system dynamics modeling of the MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea,"In 2015, Korea was faced with an unexpected yet one of the largest outbreaks, worldwide, of Middle Eastern Respiratory System (MERS). A total of 186 individuals were infected, starting with a single ""index"" patient (a.k.a., ""patient zero""), ultimately causing 38 fatalities within a two-month time period ( Choi et al., 2015 ) . Regardless of numerous scientific journals estimation of a MERS reproduction rate < 1, implying sub-epidemic potential ( Breban et al., 2013; Chowell et al., 2015 ) , the MERS outbreak in Korea has placed historical significant impact and global recognition of the vulnerability of the present-day Korean healthcare system. While Korea has enjoyed ""top-tier"" overall healthcare status, based on its placement in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rankings ( Park and Jang, 2012 ) , the recent MERS outbreak revealed shortcomings of Korean hospital and government management systems, leading to poor MERS patient care in outbreaks, as well as other ongoing patient care. Serendipitously, last year's outbreak of MERS is now being discussed as the sole responsibility of the hospital, instead of the healthcare system as a whole."
47082,Effects of operational decisions on the diffusion of epidemic disease: A system dynamics modeling of the MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea,"The single index patient in the 2015 Korea MERS outbreak, who returned from a trip to the Middle East, visited Hospital A , at which he developed a cough and fever. Hospital A referred the index patient to Hospital B . Then Hospital B referred inpatients, who made close contacts with the index patient, to different hospitals. Through referring process from hospital to hospital, facilities render vulnerability to a complex contagious disease, creating a MERS into a severe hospital-acquired infection (HAI). For example, Assiri et al., (2013) 's study identified the 21 of the 23 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection were acquired through personto-person transmission in patient care units and three different hospital facilities in Saudi Arabia, 2013. Similarly in Korea, within 10 days between the date of symptom onset to the identification of the index patient, 28 first generation MERS cases were identified ( Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015 ) . Overview of the MERS spreading process across 15 hospitals (excluding unidentified cases), and 186 confirmed cases, is summarized in Fig. 1 . Despite the high regard for Korea's level of medical practice, a defect in one medical specialty infectious disease was the primary catalyst for the rapid spread of MERS -ultimately causing social, economic and psychological impact nationwide ( Kim, 2015b ) . However, a number of hypotheses were generated to explain the spread, including: excessive patients' freedom in seeking medical care at only large hospitals, inadequate quarantine, questionable government transparency, such as belated reports of infected hospital names, and the cultural social norm of visiting patients as standard etiquette ( Choe, 2015a ( Choe, , 2015b ; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015 ) . The significance of hospital operation flaws became apparent in the MERS breakout when Hospital B infected over 80 people, through ineffective actions and lack of protocol within emergency room ( Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015 ) ."
47082,Effects of operational decisions on the diffusion of epidemic disease: A system dynamics modeling of the MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea,"While the average expected cost per patient could be as low as 8 USD, based on a 100% 6-patient room economic design, a maximum of 29.0 infected patients from one-hospital model were estimated in high infectivity situations. By merely increasing the fraction of total beds of single-patient rooms to 25% and reducing 6-patient rooms to 50%, the newly changed patient room design effectively lowered the number of infected patients by more than 50%, for an additional $83 USD per patient in both base and low infectivity scenarios. While the decrease in numbers of infected patients seemed invariable in both the low and base infectivity cases ( Fig. 8 ) , the decrease in proportion of infected patients is significant ( Table 11 ) ."
47082,Effects of operational decisions on the diffusion of epidemic disease: A system dynamics modeling of the MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea,"The comparison of economic and optimal patient room design scenarios showed that under the low infectivity scenario, patient room designs did not show significant number of infected patients, over a 10-day of period. However, under the all infectivity case scenarios, the financial savings of economic design were offset by the increased proportion of infected patients, thus worsening patient care outcome. While it is impractical to advocate exclusive singlepatient room installations, alternative designs to current economic designs are necessary."
47082,Effects of operational decisions on the diffusion of epidemic disease: A system dynamics modeling of the MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea,"Future studies on the investigation of optimal healthcare operations management could benefit by integrating other key determinants of hospital-acquired infections provided by Kim et al. (2015a) (i.e., contact control via personal protective equipment, disinfection, and environmental cleaning). Second, the model used in this research currently assumes the hospital is able to provide equal number of beds whether they are economic design (all 6-patients room) or optimal design (all single patient room) through the unrestricted ward capacity. Following assumption could impact the economic assumption, thus, future studies should consider the inclusion of financial perspective for the healthcare operational cost optimization. Lastly, future building of system dynamics model in healthcare should consider the addition of ""black box"" testing as part of the model validation process ( Brailsford et al., 2004 ) . While we did consider black box testing, which quantitatively measures and compares the simulation result with data from the actual event, we found that such analysis was beyond the purview of our current study. However, researchers, whose main objectives are to closely model the actual outbreak, could benefit from adopting such validation processes."
47265,Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) antagonizes interferon-β production via blocking IPS-1 and RIG-I,"Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), a newly discovered coronavirus, is an enveloped, positive and single-stranded sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae and the genus Alphacoronavirus (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018a) . SADS-CoV is considered to be the causative agent of the fatal swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS) with clinical manifestations of severe, acute diarrhea and rapid weight loss in piglets, which caused significantly economic losses and seriously affected the development of the porcine industry in China (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018a) . As a newly emerged coronavirus, recent researches of SADS-CoV have been mainly focused on clinical diagnosis, molecular epidemiology, evolution and animal models (Fu et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018a, b; Xu et al., 2019) . To our knowledge, interactions between SADS-CoV and the host innate immune response is unknown, and detailed information on it is yet to be obtained."
